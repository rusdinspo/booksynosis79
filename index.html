Bryan McCann chronicles the flourishing of Brazilian popular music between the 1920s and the 1950s. Through analysis of the competing projects of composers, producers, bureaucrats, and fans, he shows that Brazilians alternately envisioned popular music as the foundation for a unified national culture and used it as a tool to probe racial and regional divisions.<p></p><p>McCann explores the links between the growth of the culture industry, rapid industrialization, and the rise and fall of Get�lio Vargas&#x2019;s<i> </i>Estado Novo dictatorship. He argues that these processes opened a window of opportunity for the creation of enduring cultural patterns and demonstrates that the understandings of popular music cemented in the mid&#x2013;twentieth century continue to structure Brazilian cultural life in the early twenty-first.</p></p><p>&#34;No Latin American country offers more for the study of popular culture through music than Brazil. Bryan McCann&#39;s revelation of this neglected source will delight both Brazilian and non-Brazilian readers.&#34;--Thomas Skidmore, author of &#34;Black into White: Race and Nationality in Brazilian Thought&#34;<p>Bryan McCann is Assistant Professor of Latin American History at Georgetown University.</p></p><h2>Storm Cycle</h2><p>Rachel Kirby is a computer genius whose personal life is hell.

Christian leaders face pitfalls on every side, whether tensions from within the community or pressures from without. Those called to shepherd others get caught in power struggles and are tempted to abuse their pastoral authority. Pastors may rely on their own professional abilities and training rather than depend on God. Too often our models of leadership are shaped more by culture than by Christ, as we employ methods of ministry incompatible with true servanthood. <p>But there is hope. Lifelong pastor and renowned biblical expositor John Stott directs contemporary church leaders to the most influential leader of the early church--the apostle Paul. Unpacking the opening chapters of Paul's first epistle to the church in Corinth, Stott recovers a vision for biblical leadership, one that exemplifies the pastoral role in the midst of a troubled culture. </p><p>Pastors and church leaders will be encouraged by this stirring affirmation of the call to Christian leadership. Above all, Stott reassures us that God is at work even in the midst of our human weakness. While some of us may plant and others of us may water, ultimately it is God who brings the growth.</p></p><p>Features &amp; Benefits <p>* An important statement on Christian leadership</p><p>* Offers a countercultural, biblical perspective different from many popular leadership books</p><p>* Provides solid biblical exposition of 1 Corinthians 1--4</p><p>* Written by one of evangelicalism's most respected leaders</p><p>* The fruit of a lifetime of study and service</p><p>* Contains Stott's study guide and thorough indexes</p>"God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong." 1 Corinthians 1:27 <p>Those in Christian leadership might suspect that this verse invalidates the day-to-day reality of their ministries. They often feel that they must project strength and certainty in order to preach and minister credibly. But does this run counter to a Christian vision of leadership? </p><p>John Stott fears that too many Christian leaders have uncritically adopted secular models of leadership. The antidote, he contends, is a biblical approach to servant leadership, exemplified by the apostle Paul in his ministry to the church in Corinth. This volume provides a clear articulation of the nature of leadership as well as the thoughtful study of Scripture we have come to expect from John Stott. </p><p>Considered by many to be the elder statesman of evangelical Christianity, John Stott is himself a premier example of Paul's vision for humility and grace in Christian leadership. His insights here will encourage younger generations to follow in his steps, serving the church with the love of Christ.</p></p><h2>The Touch</h2><p>Unable to marry the woman he loves, Scottish-born Alexander Kinross writes home from the gold fields of 1860s Sydney for a bride and marries young cousin Elizabeth, who struggles with Alexander&#39;s rowdy ex-madam mistress and illegitimate son. By the author of The Thorn Birds. 150,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Colleen McCullough</b> is an Australian. Pursuing a career in neurophysiology, she lived and worked in England, then in the United States. Though she had always written novels for her own amusement, financial need spurred her to abandon fancy and write a novel designed for publication. The result was <i>Tim</i> in 1974; <i>The Thorn Birds</i> followed in 1977; thereafter came eleven novels, a cookbook, and her official biography of Sir Roden Cutler V.C. <i>The Touch</i> is her sixteenth book. <p> She lives with her husband, Ric Robinson, on Norfolk Island, in the South Pacific.</p><p><b>Chapter One: A Change of Fortune</b> </p><p> "Your cousin Alexander has written for a wife," said James Drummond, looking up from a sheet of paper. </p><p> The summons to see her father in the front parlor had fallen on Elizabeth like a blow; such formality meant a lecture for transgression, followed by a punishment appropriate for the offense. Well, she knew what she had done -- over-salted this morning's porridge -- and knew too what her punishment was bound to be -- to eat <i>un</i>salted porridge for the rest of the year. Father was careful with his money, he'd not spend it on a grain more salt than he had to. </p><p> So, hands behind her back, Elizabeth stood in front of the shabby wing chair, her mouth dropped open at this amazing news. </p><p> "He asks for Jean, which is daft -- does he think time stands still?" James brandished the letter indignantly, then transferred his gaze from it to this youngest child, light from the window pouring over her while he sat concealed by shadows. "You're made like any other female, so it will have to be you." </p><p> <i>"Me?"</i> </p><p> "Are you deaf, girl? Aye, you. Who else is there?" </p><p> "But Father! If he asks for Jean, he'll not want me." </p><p> "Any respectable, decently brought-up young woman will do, judging by the state of affairs in the place he writes from." </p><p> "Where does he write from?" she asked, knowing that she wouldn't be allowed to read the letter. </p><p> "New South Wales." James grunted, a satisfied sound. "It seems your cousin Alexander has done well for himself -- made a wee fortune on the goldfields." His brow wrinkled. "Or," he temporized, "at least has made enough to afford a wife." </p><p> Her first shock was dissipating, to be replaced by dismay. "Wouldn't it be simpler for him to find a wife there, Father?" </p><p> "In New South Wales? It's naught but harlots, ex-convicts and English snobs when it comes to women, he says. Nay, he saw Jeannie when he was last home, and took a strong fancy to her. Asked for her hand then. I refused -- well, why would I have taken a shiftless boilermaker's apprentice living in the Glasgow stews for Jeannie, and her barely sixteen? Your age, girl. That's why I'm sure you'll do for him -- he likes them young. What he's after is a Scots wife whose virtue is above reproach, whose blood he shares and can trust. That's what he says, at any rate." James Drummond rose to his feet, brushed past his daughter and marched into the kitchen. "Make me some tea." </p><p> Out came the whisky bottle while Elizabeth threw tea leaves into the warmed pot and poured boiling water on top of them. Father was a presbyter -- an elder of the kirk -- so was not a drinker, let alone a drunkard. If he poured a dollop of whisky into his teacup, it was only upon the receipt of splendid news, like the birth of a grandson. Yet why was this such splendid news? What would he do, with no daughter to look after him? </p><p> What was really in that letter? Perhaps, thought Elizabeth, accelerating the steeping of the tea by stirring it with a spoon, the whisky would provide some answers. Father when slightly befuddled was actually talkative. He might betray its secrets. </p><p> "Does my cousin Alexander have anything else to say?" she ventured as soon as the first cup was down and the second poured. </p><p> "Not very much. He's no fonder of words than any other of the Drummond ilk." Came a snort. "Drummond, indeed! It's not his name anymore, if you can believe that. He changed it to Kinross when he was in America. So you won't be Mrs. Alexander Drummond, you'll be Mrs. Alexander Kinross." </p><p> It did not occur to Elizabeth that she might dispute this arbitrary decision about her destiny, either at that moment or much later, when enough time had passed to see the thing clearly. The very thought of disobeying Father in such an important matter was more terrifying than anything she could imagine except a scolding from the Reverend Dr. Murray. Not that Elizabeth Drummond lacked courage or spirit; more that, as the motherless youngest, she had spent all her little life being tyrannized by two terrible old men, her father and his minister of religion. </p><p> "Kinross is the name of our town and county, not the name of a clan," she said. </p><p> "I daresay he had his reasons for changing," said James with unusual tolerance, sipping at his second tipple. </p><p> "Some sort of crime, Father?" </p><p> "I doubt that, or he'd not be so open now. Alexander was always headstrong, always too big for his boots. Your uncle Duncan tried, but couldn't manage him." James heaved a huge, happy sigh. "Alastair and Mary can move in with me. They'll come into a tidy sum when I'm six feet under." </p><p> "A tidy sum?" </p><p> "Aye. Your husband-to-be has sent a bank draft to cover the cost of sending you out to New South Wales. A thousand pounds." </p><p> She gaped. <i>"A thousand pounds?"</i> </p><p> "You heard me. But don't get your head turned around, girl. You can have twenty pounds to fill your glory box and five for your wedding finery. He says you're to be sent first-class and with a maid -- well, I'll not countenance such extravagance! Och, <i>awful!</i> First thing tomorrow I'll write to the Edinburgh and Glasgow newspapers to post an advertisement." Down came his spiky sandy lashes, a sign of deep thought. "What I want is a respectable married couple belonging to the kirk who are planning to emigrate to New South Wales. If they're willing to take you along, I'll pay them fifty pounds." His lids lifted to reveal his bright blue eyes. "They'll grab at it. And I'll put nine hundred and twenty-five pounds in my purse. A tidy sum." </p><p> "But will Alastair and Mary be willing to move in, Father?" </p><p> "If they're not, I'll leave my tidy sum to Robbie and Bella or Angus and Ophelia," said James Drummond smugly. </p><p> Having served him two thick bacon sandwiches for his Sunday supper, Elizabeth threw her plaid around her shoulders and escaped on the pretext that she'd better see if the cow had come home. </p><p><br> The house wherein James Drummond had brought up his large family lay on the outskirts of Kinross, a village dignified with the status of market-town because it was the capital of Kinross County. At twelve by ten miles, Kinross was the second-smallest county in Scotland, but made up for its lack of size by some slight degree of prosperity. </p><p> The woollen mill, the two flour mills and the brewery were belching black smoke, for no mill owner let his boilers go out just because it was a Sunday; cheaper than stoking from scratch on Mondays. There was sufficient coal in the southern part of the county to permit of these modest local industries, and thanks to them James Drummond had not suffered the fate of so many Scotsmen, forced to leave their native land in order to find work and live, or else subsist in the squalor of a reeking city slum. Like his elder brother, Duncan, who was Alexander's father, James had worked his fifty-five years at the woollen mill, turning out lengths of checkered cloth for the Sassenachs after the Queen had brought tartan into fashion. </p><p> The strong Scottish winds blew the stack-smoke away like charcoal under an artist's thumb and opened the pale blue vault to near-infinity. In the distance were the Ochils and the Lomonds, purple with autumn heather, high wild mountains where crofter's cottages swung decayed doors on nothing, where soon the absentee landlords would come to shoot deer, fish the lochs. Of scant concern to Kinross County, in itself a fertile plain replete with cattle, horses, sheep. The cattle were destined to become the finest London roast beef, the horses were brood mares for saddle and carriage horses, the sheep produced wool for the tartan mill and mutton for local tables. There were crops too, for the mossy soil had been extensively drained fifty years ago. </p><p> In front of Kinross town was Loch Leven, a broad, ruffled mere of that steely blue peculiar to the Scottish lochs, fed by translucent amber peat streams. Elizabeth stood on the shore only yards from the house (she knew better than to disappear from sight of it) and looked across the loch to the verdant flatlands that lay between it and the Firth of Forth. Sometimes, if the wind blew from the east, she could smell the cold, fishy depths of the North Sea, but today the wind blew off the mountains, redolent with the tang of moldering leaves. On Lochleven Isle a castle reared, the one in which Mary Queen of Scots had been imprisoned for almost a year. What must it have been like, to be both sovereign and captive? A woman trying to rule a land of fierce, outspoken men? But she had tried to bring back the Roman faith, and Elizabeth Drummond was too carefully reared a Presbyterian to think well of her for <i>that</i>. </p><p><br> I am going to a place called New South Wales to marry a man I have never met, she thought. A man who asked for my sister, not for me. I am caught in a web of my father's making. What if, when I arrive, this Alexander Kinross doesn't like me? Surely, if he is an honorable man, he will send me home again! And he must be honorable, else he would not have sent for a Drummond bride. But I have read that these rude colonies so far from home do indeed suffer a scarcity of suitable wives, so I suppose he will marry me. Dear God in Heaven, make him like me! Make me like him! </p><p><br> She had gone to Dr. Murray's school for two years, long enough to learn to read and write, and she was well, if narrowly, read; writing was more difficult, since James refused to spend money on paper for silly girls to despoil. But provided she kept the house spotlessly clean, cooked her father's meals to his liking, didn't spend any money, or hobnob with other, equally silly girls, Elizabeth was free to read whatever books she could find. She had two sources: the texts in the library of Dr. Murray's manse and the drearily respectable novels that circulated among the feminine members of his massive congregation. No surprise, then, that she was more informed about theology than geology, and circumstance than romance. </p><p> That marriage would be her lot had never occurred to her, though she was just beginning to be old enough to wonder about its pleasures and perils, to look at her older siblings' unions with fascinated interest. Alastair and Mary, so different, always arguing, yet, she sensed, enjoying some deeper communion; Robert and Bella, perfectly matched in parsimony; Angus and his twittery Ophelia, who seemed determined to destroy each other; Catherine and her Robert, who lived in Kirkaldy because he was a fisherman; Mary and her James, Anne and her Angus, Margaret and William....And Jean, the oldest daughter, the family beauty, who at eighteen had married a Montgomery -- an enviable catch for a girl of good enough blood but absolutely no dowry. Her husband had removed her to a mansion in Princes Street, Edinburgh, and that was the last time the Drummonds in Kinross ever saw Jean. </p><p> "Ashamed of us," said James with contempt. </p><p> "Very canny," said Alastair, who had loved her and was loyal. </p><p> "Very selfish," said Mary, sneering. </p><p> Very lonely, thought Elizabeth, who remembered Jean only vaguely. But if Jean's loneliness became too much to bear, her family was a mere fifty miles away. Whereas I will never be able to come home, and home is all I know. </p><p> It had been decided after Margaret married that Elizabeth, the last of James's brood who lived, was to remain a spinster at least until her father died, which family superstition believed would not be for many years to come; he was as tough as old boots and as hard as the rock of Ben Lomond. Now all of it had changed, thanks to Alexander Kinross and a thousand pounds. Alastair, James's pride and joy after the death of his namesake, would override Mary and move her and his seven children into his father's house. It would go to him anyway in the fullness of time, for he had cemented his place in James's affections by succeeding his father as loom master at the mill. But Mary -- poor Mary, how she would suffer! Father deemed her a shocking spendthrift, between buying her children <i>shoes</i> to wear on Sundays and putting <i>jam</i> on the table for breakfast as well as for supper. Once she moved in with James, her children would wear boots and jam would appear only for Sunday supper. </p><p> The wind began to bluster; Elizabeth shivered, more from fear than the sudden chill. What had Father said of Alexander Kinross? "A shiftless boilermaker's apprentice living in the Glasgow stews." What did he mean by shiftless? That Alexander Kinross stuck to nothing? If he was shiftless, would he even be there to meet her at journey's end? </p><p> "Elizabeth, come inside!" James was shouting. </p><p> Obedient, Elizabeth ran. </p><p><br> As the days flew by they conspired to give Elizabeth little time for reflection; try as she did to stay awake in her bed and think about her fate, the moment she lay down, sleep claimed her. Every day saw quarrels between James and Mary; Alastair, away to the mill at dawn and not returning until after dark, was fortunate. All of Mary's own furniture had to be moved to her new residence, and took precedence over James's chipped, battered pieces. If Elizabeth wasn't running up and down the stairs with armloads of linens or clothing (including shoes) or on one end of the piano, the bureau, the chiffer-robe, she was outside with one of Mary's rugs spread over the clothesline, beating it within an inch of its life. Mary was a cousin on the Murray side, and had come to her marriage with a certain amount of property, a small allowance from her farmer father, and more independence of mind than Elizabeth had credited any woman could possess. None of which had impinged on her in the way it did after Mary came to live with Father. Who didn't always win the battles, she was amazed to discover. The jam stayed on the breakfast table every morning and was there again every night. The children's shoes went on their feet before service at Dr. Murray's kirk on Sundays. And Mary flirted her shapely ankles in a pair of exquisite blue kid slippers with heels high enough to turn her walk into a mince. James spent much of his time in towering rages and soon had his grandchildren in healthy fear of his stick, but Alastair, he was learning, had become putty in Mary's hands. </p><p> Elizabeth's only chance to avoid this domestic turmoil were visits to Miss MacTavish's establishment in Kinross's main square. It was a small house whose front parlor, opening straight on to the pavement, bore a big glass window in which stood a sexless dummy clad in a very full-skirted pink taffeta dress -- it would never do to offend the kirk by showing a dummy with <i>breasts</i>. </p><p> Everyone who didn't make her own clothing went to see Miss MacTavish, an attenuated spinster lady in her late forties, who, upon inheriting a hundred pounds, had given up employment as a seamstress and opened her own business as a modiste. It and she had prospered, for Kinross contained women able to afford her services, and she was clever enough to produce magazines of ladies' fashions that she insisted were sent to her from London. </p><p> Five of Elizabeth's twenty pounds had gone on tartan wools from the mill, where Alastair's position allowed her a small but welcome discount. These and four...</p></p><h2>Monsieur Teste</h2><p>ENGLISH EDITION--see MY pic--1964, first McGraw Hill printing in paper. Some underlining, but solid book.

Because this is a "Harry Potterless" year, kids in need of a fix may find it in these two volumes. The conceit is that these are Harry's schoolbooks (<i>Fantastic </i> Beasts, by Newt Scamander; <i>Quidditch,</i> by Kennilworthy Whisp), with margin notes by Harry and pal Ron Weasley. The concept breaks down in the introductions: Professor Dumbledore explains that the books are being offered to muggles (because the proceeds of the books are going to British charity Comic Relief, a disclosure that will raise the eyebrows of any reader who undestands the importance of secrecy in the wizard world. Nevertheless, a lot of effort has gone into making these seem like real textbooks. The jackets look torn and faded, the print is (annoyingly) small, and the information is well detailed. Illustrations are in short supply, and not every fan will want to know this much about Quidditch and imaginary beasts, especially when the text is so hard to read.

So begins "As Birds Bring Forth the Sun," a 1985 entry from <i>Island</i>. The story continues, "And the man had a dog of which he was very fond." And there you have the basic elements of an Alistair MacLeod story: dog, family, and sea. The author--whose 2000 novel <i>No Great Mischief</i> won him a measure of long-overdue acclaim--shuffles these elements into a surprisingly infinite variety of configurations, always with the same precise, confident, quiet language.<p> His big theme is the abandonment of the rural. Though his characters live in the fishing communities of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, the seaside isn't a place where they dwell contentedly. In half the stories, young men and boys feel a pull toward academe and the center of the country. In the other half, academically successful middle-aged men return to the wild eastern coast of Canada to try to reclaim the life they left behind. Both dilemmas are impossible to resolve--no one can be both a city mouse and a country mouse--and MacLeod wisely doesn't offer easy solutions. </p><p> What makes the writing sing, though, is the specificity of his descriptions of rural life. He tells you exactly how things work: "The sheep move in and out of their lean-to shelter, restlessly stamping their feet or huddling together in tightly packed groups. A conspiracy of wool against the cold." The people here are ultimately defined by the physical world, and MacLeod has a farmer's visceral feel for geography. As he writes in "The Lost Salt Gift of Blood": "Even farther out, somewhere beyond Cape Spear lies Dublin and the Irish coast; far away but still the nearest land, and closer now than is Toronto or Detroit, to say nothing of North America's more western cities; seeming almost hazily visible now in imagination's mist." This is regional fiction in the best sense: it belongs to one perfectly evoked place. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>The sixteen exquisitely crafted stories in <b>Island</b> prove Alistair MacLeod to be a master. Quietly, precisely, <br>He has created a body of work that is among the greatest to appear in English in the last fifty years. <br><br>A book-besotted patriarch releases his only son from the obligations of the sea. A father provokes his young son to violence when he reluctantly sells the family horse. A passionate girl who grows up on a nearly deserted island turns into an ever-wistful woman when her one true love is felled by a logging accident. A dying young man listens to his grandmother play the old Gaelic songs on her ancient violin as they both fend off the inevitable. The events that propel MacLeod's stories convince us of the importance of tradition, the beauty of the landscape, and the necessity of memory.</p><h2>The Industrial Revolution: Investigate How Science and Technology Changed the World with 25 Projects (Build It Yourself)</h2><p><p>Imagine a world without brand-name products!

"Things you hardly noticed before took on enormous significance: a comfortable, solid armchair, the soothing look of a white-tiled stove," writes Wladyslaw Szpilman, a pianist for Polish radio when the Germans invaded. His mother's insistence on laying the table with clean linen for their midday meal, even as conditions for Jews worsened daily, makes palpable the Holocaust's abstract horror. Arbitrarily removed from the transport that took his family to certain death, Szpilman does not deny the "animal fear" that led him to seize this chance for escape, nor does he cheapen his emotions by belaboring them. Yet his cool prose contains plenty of biting rage, mostly buried in scathing asides (a Jewish doctor spared consignment to "the most wonderful of all gas chambers," for example). Szpilman found compassion in unlikely people, including a German officer who brought food and warm clothing to his hiding place during the war's last days. Extracts from the officer's wartime diary (added to this new edition), with their expressions of outrage at his fellow soldiers' behavior, remind us to be wary of general condemnation of any group. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"[Szpilman's] account is hair-raising beyond anything Hollywood could invent...an altogether unforgettable book." -- <i>THE DAILY TELEGRAPH </i><p> "[Szpilman's] shock and ensuing numbness become ours, so that acts of ordinary kindness or humanity take on an aura of miracle. --<i>THE OBSERVER </i></p><p> "Rarely has the sheer claustrophobia of living in the Warsaw Ghetto been so vividly conveyed as it is by Szpilman." --<i>THE INDEPENDENT </i></p></p><h2>Dumbing Down Our Kids: Why America&#39;s Children Feel Good About Themselves but Can&#39;t Read, Write, or Add</h2><p>The author of A Nation of Victims offers an expose+a7 of American public education, charging that faddish educational theories and the drive to inflate students&#39; self-esteem are causing standards to decline. National ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>Nowhere has the flight from quality plaguing American life these days been more obvious than in our primary and secondary schools -- on the whole, the graduates seem less well-read and less well-spoken, less knowledgeable and less able to compute. In this book, Charles Sykes asks why, and lays most of the blame at the feet of the trainers of teachers, the writers of textbooks and the educational policy wonks who influence them. He convincingly shows that in many different school systems, and in many different academic fields, with the help of goofy text-books, watered-down requirements and &#34;recentered&#34; test grade scales, American students have come to value feeling good about a subject over being good in it. Sykes&#39;s recommended reforms include abolishing the federal Department of Education and its state counterparts, abolishing undergraduate schools of education, establishing more alternative routes to teacher certification and merit raises for good teachers.

The accused is the unimpeachable Sir Hugo Drax, head of the multi-million-pound Moonraker missile programme on which Britain&#39;s future depends.</p><p>Born in London in 1908, Ian Fleming worked variously as a banker and journalist before serving in the British Naval Intelligence during World War II. He published his first novel CASINO ROYALE in 1953 and thus started the astoundingly successful James Bond novels and films. Fleming died in 1964.<b>1. SECRET PAPERWORK </b> <p>The two thirty-eights roared simultaneously.</p> <p>The walls of the underground room took the crash of sound and batted it to and fro between them until there was silence. James Bond watched the smoke being sucked from each end of the room towards the central Ventaxia fan. The memory in his right hand of how he had drawn and fired with one sweep from the left made him confident. He broke the chamber sideways out of the Colt Detective Special and waited, his gun pointing at the floor, while the Instructor walked the twenty yards towards him through the half-light of the gallery.</p> <p>Bond saw that the Instructor was grinning. 'I don't believe it,' he said. 'I got you that time.'</p> <p>The Instructor came up with him. 'I'm in hospital, but you're dead, sir,' he said. In one hand he held the silhouette target of the upper body of a man. In the other a polaroid film, postcard size. He handed this to Bond and they turned to a table behind them on which there was a green-shaded desk-light and a large magnifying glass.</p> <p>Bond picked up the glass and bent over the photograph. It was a flash-light photograph of him. Around his right hand there was a blurred burst of white flame. He focused the glass carefully on the left side of his dark jacket. In the centre of his heart there was a tiny pinpoint of light.</p> <p>Without speaking, the Instructor laid the big white man-shaped target under the lamp. Its heart was a black bullseye, about three inches across. Just below and half an inch to the right was the rent made by Bond's bullet.</p> <p>'Through the left wall of the stomach and out at the back,' said the Instructor, with satisfaction. He took out a pencil and scribbled an addition on the side of the target.' Twenty rounds and I make it you owe me seven-and-six, sir,' he said impassively.</p> <p>Bond laughed. He counted out some silver. 'Double the stakes next Monday,' he said. 'That's all right with me,' said the Instructor. 'But you can't beat the machine, sir. And if you want to get into the team for the Dewar Trophy we ought to give the thirty-eights a rest and spend some time on the Remington. That new long twenty-two cartridge they've just brought out is going to mean at least 7900 out of a possible 8000 to win. Most of your bullets have got to be in the X-ring and that's only as big as a shilling when it's under your nose. At a hundred yards it isn't there at all.'</p> <p>'To hell with the Dewar Trophy,' said Bond. 'It's your money I'm after.' He shook the unfired bullets in the chamber of his gun into his cupped hand and laid them and the gun on the table.' See you Monday. Same time ?'</p> <p>'Ten O'clock'11 be fine, sir,' said the Instructor, jerking down the two handles on the iron door. He smiled at Bond's back as it disappeared up the steep concrete stairs leading to the ground floor. He was pleased with Bond's shooting, but he wouldn't have thought of telling him that he was the best shot in the Service. Only M was allowed to know that, and his Chief of Staff, who would be told to enter the scores of that day's shoot on Bond's Confidential Record.</p> <p>Bond pushed through the green baize door at the top of the basement steps and walked over to the lift that would take him up to the eighth floor of the tall, grey building near Regent's Park that is the headquarters of the Secret Service. He was satisfied with his score but not proud of it. His trigger finger twitched in his pocket as he wondered how to conjure up that little extra flash of speed that would beat the machine, the complicated box of tricks that sprung the target for just three seconds, fired back at him with a blank .38, and shot a pencil of light aimed at him and photographed it as he stood and fired from the circle of chalk on the floor.</p> <p>The lift doors sighed open and Bond got in. The liftman could smell the cordite on him. They always smelled like that when they came up from the shooting gallery. He liked it. It reminded him of the Army. He pressed the button for the eighth and rested the stump of his left arm against the control handle.</p> <p>If only the light was better, thought Bond. But M insisted that all shooting should be done in averagely bad conditions. A dim light and a target that shot back at you was as close as he could get to copying the real thing. 'Shooting hell out of apiece of cardboard doesn't prove anything' was his single-line introduction to the Small-arms Defence Manual.</p> <p>The lift eased to a stop and as Bond stepped out into the drab Ministry-of-Works-green corridor and into the bustling world of girls carrying files, doors opening and shutting, and muted telephone bells, he emptied his mind of all thoughts of his shoot and prepared himself for the normal business of a routine day at Headquarters.</p> <p>He walked along to the end door on the right. It was as anonymous as all the others he had passed. No numbers. If you had any business on the eighth floor, and your office was not on that floor, someone would come and fetch you to the room you needed and see you back into the lift when you were through.</p> <p>Bond knocked and waited. He looked at his watch. Eleven o'clock. Mondays were hell. Two days of dockets and files to plough through. And week-ends were generally busy times abroad. Empty flats got burgled. People were photographed in compromising positions. Motorcar 'accidents' looked better, got a more cursory handling, amidst the week-end slaughter on the roads. The weekly bags from Washington, Istanbul, and Tokyo would have come in and been sorted. They might hold something for him.</p> <p>The door opened and he had his daily moment of pleasure at having a beautiful secretary. 'Morning, Lil,' he said.</p> <p>The careful warmth other smile of welcome dropped about ten degrees.</p> <p>'Give me that coat,' she said. 'It stinks of cordite. And don't call me Lil. You know I hate it.'</p> <p>Bond took off his coat and handed it to her. 'Anyone who gets christened Loelia Ponsonby ought to get used to pet names.'</p> <p>He stood beside her desk in the little anteroom which she had somehow made to seem a little more human than an office and watched her hang his coat on the iron frame of the open window.</p> <p>She was tall and dark with a reserved, unbroken beauty to which the war and five years in the Service had lent a touch of sternness. Unless she married soon, Bond thought for the hundredth time, or had a lover, her cool air of authority might easily become spinsterish and she would join the army of women who had married a career.</p> <p>Bond had told her as much, often, and he and the two other members of the 00 Section had at various times made determined assaults on her virtue. She had handled them all with the same cool motherliness (which, to salve their egos, they privately defined as frigidity) and, the day after, she treated them with small attentions and kindnesses to show that it was really her fault and that she forgave them.</p> <p>What they didn't know was that she worried herself almost to death when they were in danger and that she loved them equally; but that she had no intention of becoming emotionally involved with any man who might be dead next week. And it was true that an appointment in the Secret Service was a form of peonage. If you were a woman there wasn't much of you left for other relationships. It was easier for the men. They had an excuse for fragmentary affairs. For them marriage and children and a home were out of the question if they were to be of any use 'in the field' as it was cosily termed. But, for the women, an affair outside the Service automatically made you a 'security risk' and in the last analysis you had a choice of resignation from the Service and a normal life, or of perpetual concubinage to your King and Country.</p> <p>Loelia Ponsonby knew that she had almost reached the time for decision and all her instincts told her to get out. But every day the drama and romance of her Cavell-Nightingale world locked her more securely into the company of the other girls at Headquarters and every day it seemed more difficult to betray by resignation the father-figure which The Service had become.</p> <p>Meanwhile she was one of the most envied girls in the building, and a member of the small company of Principal Secretaries who had access to the innermost secrets of the Service - 'The Pearls and Twin-set' as they were called behind their backs by the other girls, with ironical reference to their supposedly 'Country' and 'Kensington' backgrounds - and, so far as thePersonnel Branch was concerned, her destiny in twenty years' time would be that single golden line right at the end of a New Year's Honours List, among the medals for officials of the Fishery Board, of the Post Office, of the Women's Institute, towards the bottom of the OBEs: 'Miss Loelia Ponsonby, Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Defence.'</p> <p>She turned away from the window. She was dressed in a sugar-pink and white striped shirt and a plain dark blue skirt.</p> <p>Bond smiled into her grey eyes. 'I only call you Lil on Mondays,' he said. 'Miss Ponsonby the rest of the week. But I'll never call you Loelia. It sounds like somebody in an indecent limerick. Any messages?'</p> <p>'No,' she said shortly. She relented. 'But there's piles of stuff on your desk. Nothing urgent. But there's an awful lot of it. Oh, and the powder-vine says that 008's got out. He's in Berlin, resting. Isn't it wonderful!'</p> <p>Bond looked quickly at her. 'When did you hear that?'</p> <p>'About half an hour ago,' she said.</p> <p>Bond opened the inner door to the big office with the three desks and shut it behind him. He went and stood by the window, looking out at the late spring green of the trees in Regent's Park. So Bill had made it after all. Peenemunde and back. Resting in Berlin sounded bad. Must be in pretty poor shape. Well, he'd just have to wait for news from the only leak in the building - the girls' rest-room, known to the impotent fury of the Security staff as 'The powder-vine'.</p> <p>Bond sighed and sat down at his desk, pu...</p></p><h2>Vampirates: Empire of Night (Vampirates, 5)</h2><p>After the surprising revelation of the Tempest family history, twins Connor and Grace face a newly-defined future marked by their Vampirate roots.

He lives with his family&nbsp;in Santa Clara, California</em>Gr 9 Up&#x2014;In this fourth of Jim�nez's autobiographies, the author recounts his life from when he started his graduate work at Columbia University in the late 1960s to when he began his professorship at Santa Clara University in 1973. Jim�nez refers frequently to the poverty he and his migrant family experienced when he was a child. The anxiety wrought by his family's dearth of resources instilled in him an ongoing fear that he was inadequate to meet the financial and academic challenges before him. Jim�nez demonstrates that by dint of intelligence, tenacity, and help from friends and professors, he was able to obtain the education he desired so fervently. Jim�nez's memory is capacious. He remembers the color of the suit he wore on his first day at Columbia (light green) and the cost of rent for the first two apartments where he and his wife lived ($150 and $175). These details are interesting but without modern context will not mean much to most readers. Jim�nez re-creates some scenes with resonant clarity, emphasizing the necessity of pinching pennies and the joy of finding out his wife was pregnant. Other elements are not as strong. Lengthy descriptions of his academic pursuits go beyond the intended readership's interests and educational experience. Overall, this is an eloquent work about overcoming poverty to receive an advanced education.

Now, in his most daring novel yet, a mysterious transmission from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean leads a crew of oceanographers and divers to a phenomenon beyond scientific understanding - a discovery that will change everything we know about life on Earth...</p><p>Perry Berg is president of Benthic Marine and a passenger aboard The Benthic Explorer, a 450-foot research ship endeavoring to drill into, and sample for the first time, the earth's magma core. Also onboard are the lovely Dr. Suzanne Newell; ex-navy commander and present submersible skipper Donald Fuller; and navy-cum-Neanderthal divers Richard Adams and Michael Donaghue. It is this cast of characters who, with the reluctant Perry, dive to the stilled drill site in order to make repairs. En route, they are sucked (or suckered) into a defunct undersea volcano and deposited into an otherworldly wonderland. That takes about 75 pages of fairly cogent spadework. The next 375 pages sprout some of the looniest, most derivative, made-for-TV-movie science fiction imaginable. Our heroes, you see, have been abducted to Interterra, an undersea world of staggering beauty and unheard of technologies--intergalactic travel and eternal life, for starters--populated by stunningly beautiful, toga-wearing, first-generation humans.<p> First-generation? They were here first, see, and had been doing very nicely until their scientists realized that the earth was about to be "showered with planetesimal collisions, just as had happened in its primordial state," and that they had better start digging. While the Interterrans prospered and thrived undersea, we, the second generation, began hauling our single-celled bodies up by our ooze-straps and started all over again.</p><p> And that's about it. People with names like Arak and Sufa speak strangely, giggle at the primitive second-generationists, recoil at the very thought of violence, press their palms together to have sex, and direct "worker clones" to do the dishes while the second generation does its stereotypical best to, in turns, exemplify, define, and defile humankind.</p><p> If you've yet to read Robin Cook's innumerable (and mostly successful) medical thrillers, start now.

American Poetry: The Nineteenth Century reveals the vigor and diversity of a tradition embracing solitary visionaries and congenial storytellers, humorists and dissidents, songwriters and philosophers. These two volumes reassess America&#39;s poetic legacy with a comprehensive sweep that no previous anthology has attempted. This second volume follows the evolution of American poetry from the monumental mid-century achievements of Herman Melville and Emily Dickinson to the modernist stirrings of Stephen Crane and Edwin Arlington Robinson. The cataclysm of the Civil War - reflected in fervent antislavery protests, in marching songs and poetic calls to arms, and in muted postbellum expressions of grief and reconciliation - ushered in a period of accelerating change and widening regional perspectives. Among the unfamiliar pleasures to be savored in this volume are the penetrating meditations of the reclusive Frederick Goddard Tuckerman, the eloquent lyricism of Emma Lazarus, the mournful, superbly crafted fin de siecle verse of Trumbull Stickney. Here too are the pioneering African-American poets (Frances Harper, Albery Allson Whitman, Paul Laurence Dunbar); popular humorists (James Whitcomb Riley, Eugene Field); writers embodying America&#39;s newfound cosmopolitanism (Edith Wharton, George Santayana); and extravagant self-mythologizing figures who could have existed nowhere else, like the actress Adah Isaacs Menken and the frontier poet Joaquin Miller. Parodies, dialect poems, song lyrics, and children&#39;s verse evoke the liveliness of an era when poetry was accessible toall. Here are poems that played a crucial role in American public life, whether to arouse the national conscience (Edwin Markham&#39;s &#34;The Man with the Hoe&#34;) or to memorialize the golden age of the national pastime (Ernest Lawrence Thayer&#39;s &#34;Casey at the Bat&#34;). An entire section of this volume is devoted to American Indian poetry in nineteenth-century versions, making available - some for the first time since their initial publication - an astonishing range of translations and adaptations: Ojibwa healing rituals, the songs of the Ghost Dance religion, Zuni mythological narratives, chants from the Kwakiutl Winter Ceremonial. Also included is a generous selection from America&#39;s rich heritage of anonymous folk songs, ballads, and hymns. Unprecedented in its textual authority, the anthology includes newly researched biographical sketches of each poet, a year-by-year chronology of poets and poetry from 1800 to 1900, and extensive notes.<b>John Hollander&nbsp;</b>(1929-2013), editor, was a distinguished poet, critic, and teacher whose many collections included&nbsp;<i>The Night Mirror</i>&nbsp;(1971),&nbsp;<i>Reflections on Espionage</i>(1976),&nbsp;<i>Spectral Emanations</i>&nbsp;(1978), and&nbsp;<i>Powers of Thirteen</i>&nbsp;(1983).

It was a deceptively simple story - five characters, the events of a few days, the intrigues of families and lovers. The place is Rome. The central figure is Michele, a young man in confused but furious rebellion against the emptiness of bourgeois life. His father is dead; his mother, Mariagrazia, desperately clings to her bored lover, Leo; his sister has no hope of marriage or career and bleakly prepares to give herself to Leo as well. A frequent visitor is Leo&#39;s former lover, Lisa, ostensibly Mariagrazia&#39;s friend, a woman who feels she is in the final late bloom before age destroys beauty. She longs to make Michele her lover, but he is bored and disgusted by her pretenses, her vanity, her desperation. All five are cast loose on the sea of modern life - obsessed with what they want, what they feel they are owed, the wrongs that have been done them, their loneliness. What Moravia destroys forever in this pitiless novel is the illusion that a world of ever-growing material comfort can ever feed the human soul.</p><p>ALBERTO MORAVIA began this novel when he was eighteen and confined to bed with a long illness. Author of more than twenty books, he was married to the well-known Italian writers Elsa Morante and Dacia Maraini. He died in his apartment in Rome on the day in 1990 when the first copies of his autobiography, Life of Moravia, arrived from the printer.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Italian</p><h2>Maigret and the Hotel Majestic</h2><p>When the corpse of a guest in a Paris luxury hotel is discovered by the breakfast cook in the basement, Maigret searches for the culprit among the hotel&#39;s employees and patrons</p><p>Georges Simenon (1903-1989) was born in Lie`ge, Belgium.

If any of this sounds familiar, chances are that you&#39;re a woman.Invisible Women shows us how, in a world largely built for and by men, we are systematically ignoring half the population. It exposes the gender data gap - a gap in our knowledge that is at the root of perpetual, systemic discrimination against women, and that has created a pervasive but invisible bias with a profound effect on women&#39;s lives.From government policy and medical research, to technology, workplaces, urban planning and the media, Invisible Women reveals the biased data that excludes women.Award-winning campaigner and writer Caroline Criado Perez brings together for the first time an impressive range of case studies, stories and new research from across the world that illustrate the hidden ways in which women are forgotten, and the impact this has on their health and well-being.

The legendary Omaha investor has never written a memoir, but now he has allowed one writer, Alice Schroeder, unprecedented access to explore directly with him and with those closest to him his work, opinions, struggles, triumphs, follies, and wisdom. The result is the personally revealing and complete biography of the man known everywhere as &#x201c;The Oracle of Omaha.&#x201d;<br><br>Although the media track him constantly, Buffett himself has never told his full life story. His reality is private, especially by celebrity standards. Indeed, while the homespun persona that the public sees is true as far as it goes, it goes only so far. Warren Buffett is an array of paradoxes. He set out to prove that nice guys can finish first. Over the years he treated his investors as partners, acted as their steward, and championed honesty as an investor, CEO, board member, essayist, and speaker. At the same time he became the world&#x2019;s richest man, all from the modest Omaha headquarters of his company Berkshire Hathaway. None of this fits the term &#x201c;simple.&#x201d;<br><br>When Alice Schroeder met Warren Buffett she was an insurance industry analyst and a gifted writer known for her keen perception and business acumen. Her writings on finance impressed him, and as she came to know him she realized that while much had been written on the subject of his investing style, no one had moved beyond that to explore his larger philosophy, which is bound up in a complex personality and the details of his life. Out of this came his decision to cooperate with her on the book about himself that he would never write.<br><br>Never before has Buffett spent countless hours responding to a writer&#x2019;s questions, talking, giving complete access to his wife, children, friends, and business associates&#x2014;opening his files, recalling his childhood. It was an act of courage, as <i>The Snowball </i>makes immensely clear. Being human, his own life, like most lives, has been a mix of strengths and frailties. Yet notable though his wealth may be, Buffett&#x2019;s legacy will not be his ranking on the scorecard of wealth; it will be his principles and ideas that have enriched people&#x2019;s lives. This audiobook tells you why Warren Buffett is the most fascinating American success story of our time.</p><p><b>Alice Schroeder</b> was a Wall Street analyst and a managing director at Morgan Stanley when she decided at Warren Buffett&#x2019;s suggestion to write full-time. A former CPA, she lives in Connecticut with her husband.<b><i>Chapter One<br></i><br>The Less Flattering Version</b><br><br>Omaha, June 2003<br><br>Warren Buffett rocks back in his chair, long legs crossed at the knee behind his father Howard&#x2019;s plain wooden desk. His expensive Zegna suit jacket bunches around his shoulders like an untailored version bought off the rack. The jacket stays on all day, every day, no matter how casually the other fifteen employees at Berkshire Hathaway headquarters are dressed. His predictable white shirt sits low on the neck, its undersize collar bulging away from his tie, looking left over from his days as a young businessman, as if he had forgotten to check his neck size for the last forty years. <br><br>His hands lace behind his head through strands of whitening hair. One particularly large and messy finger-combed chunk takes off over his skull like a ski jump, lofting upward at the knoll of his right ear. His shaggy right eyebrow wanders toward it above the tortoiseshell glasses. At various times this eyebrow gives him a skeptical, knowing, or beguiling look. Right now he wears a subtle smile, which lends the wayward eyebrow a captivating air. Nonetheless, his pale-blue eyes are focused and intent. <br><br>He sits surrounded by icons and mementos of fifty years. In the hallways outside his office, Nebraska Cornhuskers football photographs, his paycheck from an appearance on a soap opera, the offer letter (never accepted) to buy a hedge fund called Long-Term Capital Management, and Coca-Cola memorabilia everywhere. On the coffee table inside the office, a classic Coca-Cola bottle. A baseball glove encased in Lucite. Over the sofa, a certificate that he completed Dale Carnegie&#x2019;s public-speaking course in January 1952. The Wells Fargo stagecoach, westbound atop a bookcase. A Pulitzer Prize, won in 1973 by the <i>Sun </i>Newspapers of Omaha, which his investment partnership owned. Scattered about the room are books and newspapers. Photographs of his family and friends cover the credenza and a side table, and sit under the hutch beside his desk in place of a computer. A large portrait of his father hangs above Buffett&#x2019;s head on the wall behind his desk. It faces every visitor who enters the room. <br><br>Although a late-spring Omaha morning beckons outside the windows, the brown wooden shutters are closed to block the view. The television beaming toward his desk is tuned to CNBC. The sound is muted, but the crawl at the bottom of the screen feeds him news all day long. Over the years, to his pleasure, the news has often been about him. <br><br>Only a few people, however, actually know him well. I have been acquainted with him for six years, originally as a financial analyst covering Berkshire Hathaway stock. Over time our relationship has turned friendly, and now I will get to know him better still. We are sitting in Warren&#x2019;s office because he is not going to write a book. The unruly eyebrows punctuate his words as he says repeatedly, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll do a better job than I would, Alice. I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re writing this book, not me.&#x201d; Why he would say that is something that will eventually become clear. In the meantime, we start with the matter closest to his heart. <br><br>&#x201c;Where did it come from, Warren? Caring so much about making money?&#x201d; <br><br>His eyes go distant for a few seconds, thoughts traveling inward: <i>flip flip flip </i>through the mental files. Warren begins to tell his story: &#x201c;Balzac said that behind every great fortune lies a crime. [1] That&#x2019;s not true at Berkshire.&#x201d; <br><br>He leaps out of his chair to bring home the thought, crossing the room in a couple of strides. Landing on a mustardy-gold brocade armchair, he leans forward, more like a teenager bragging about his first romance than a seventy-two-year-old financier. How to interpret the story, who else to interview, what to write: The book is up to me. He talks at length about human nature and memory&#x2019;s frailty, then says, &#x201c;Whenever my version is different from somebody else&#x2019;s, Alice, use the less flattering version.&#x201d; <br><br>Among the many lessons, some of the best come simply from observing him. Here is the first: Humility disarms. <br><br>In the end, there won&#x2019;t be too many reasons to choose the less flattering version&#x2013;but when I do, human nature, not memory&#x2019;s frailty, is usually why. One of those occasions happened at Sun Valley in 1999.<br><b>Chapter Two</b><br><br><b>Sun Valley </b><br><br><i>Idaho, July 1999 </i><br><br>Warren Buffett stepped out of his car and pulled his suitcase from the trunk. He walked through the chain-link gate onto the airport&#x2019;s tarmac, where a gleaming white Gulfstream IV jet&#x2013;the size of a regional commercial airliner and the largest private aircraft in the world in 1999&#x2013;waited for him and his family. One of the pilots grabbed the suitcase from him to stow in the cargo hold. Every new pilot who flew with Buffett was shocked to see him carrying his own luggage from a car he drove himself. Now, as he climbed the boarding stairs, he said hello to the flight attendant&#x2013;somebody new&#x2013;and headed to a seat next to a window, which he would not glance out of at any time during the flight. His mood was buoyant; he had been anticipating this trip for weeks. <br><br>His son Peter and daughter-in-law Jennifer, his daughter Susan and her boyfriend, and two of his grandchildren all settled into their own caf� au lait leather club chairs set around the forty-five-foot-long cabin. They swiveled their seats away from the curved wall panels to give themselves more space as the flight attendant brought drinks from the galley, which was stocked with the family&#x2019;s favorite snacks and beverages. A pile of magazines lay nearby on the sofa: <i>Vanity Fair, </i>the <i>New Yorker, Fortune, Yachting, </i>the <i>Robb Report, </i>the <i>Atlantic Monthly, </i>the <i>Economist, Vogue, Yoga Journal. </i>She brought Buffett an armload of newspapers instead, along with a basket of potato chips and a Cherry Coke that matched his red Nebraska sweater. He complimented her, chatted for a few minutes to ease her nervousness at flying for the first time with her boss, and told her that she could let the copilot know that they were ready to take off. Then he buried his head in a newspaper as the plane rolled down the runway and ascended to forty thousand feet. For the next two hours, six people hummed around him, watching videos, talking, and making phone calls, while the flight attendant set out linens and bud vases filled with orchids on the bird&#x2019;s-eye maple dining tables before returning to the galley to prepare lunch. Buffett never moved. He sat reading, hidden behind his newspapers, as if he were alone in his study at home. <br><br>They were flying in a $30 million airborne palace called a &#x201c;fractional&#x201d; jet. As many as eight owners shared it, but it served as part of a fleet, so all the owners could fly at once if they wished. The pilots in the cockpit, the crew that maintained it, the schedulers who got it to the gate on six hours&#x2019; notice, and the flight attendant who served their lunch all worked for NetJets, which belonged to Warren Buffett&#x2019;s company, Berkshire Hathaway. <br><br>Sometime later, the G-IV crossed the Snake River Plain and approached the Sawtooth Mountains, a vast Cretaceous upheaval of dark and ancient granite mounds baking in the summer sun. It sailed through the bright clear air into the Wood River Valley, descending to eight thousand feet, where it started to buck on the mountain wave of turbulence thrown into the sky by the brown foothills beneath. Buffett read on, unperturbed, as the plane rocked and his family jerked about in their seats. Brush dotted higher altitudes of a second ridge of hills and rows of pines began their march up the ridges between ravines on the leeward side. The family grinned with anticipation. As the aircraft descended through the narrowing slot between the rising mountain peaks ahead, the midday sun cast the plane&#x2019;s lengthening shadow over the old mining town of Hailey, Idaho. <br><br>A few seconds later, the wheels touched down on the Friedman Memorial Airport runway. By the time the Buffetts had bounded down the stairs onto the tarmac, squinting in the July sunshine, two SUVs had driven through the gate and pulled up alongside the jet, driven by men and women from Hertz. They all wore the company&#x2019;s gold-and-black shirts. Instead of Hertz, however, the logo said &#x201c;Allen &amp; Co.&#x201d; <br><br>The grandchildren bounced on their heels as the pilots unloaded the luggage, tennis rackets, and Buffett&#x2019;s red-and-white Coca-Cola golf bag into the SUVs. Then he and the others shook hands with the pilots, said good-bye to the flight attendant, and climbed into the SUVs. Bypassing Sun Valley Aviation&#x2013; a pocket-size trailer at the runway&#x2019;s southern end&#x2013;they swung through the chain-link gate onto the road that led to the peaks beyond. About two minutes had elapsed since the plane&#x2019;s wheels first touched the runway. <br><br>Right on schedule, eight minutes later, another jet followed theirs, headed to its own runway parking spot. <br><br>Throughout the golden afternoon, jet after jet cruised into Idaho from the south and east or swung around the peaks from the west and descended into Hailey: workhorse Cessna Citations; glamorous, close-quartered Learjets; speedy Hawkers; luxurious Falcons; but mostly the awe-inspiring G-IVs. As the afternoon waned, dozens of huge, gleaming white aircraft lined the runway like a shop window full of tycoons&#x2019; toys. <br><br>The Buffetts followed the trail blazed by earlier SUVs a few miles onward from the airport to the tiny town of Ketchum on the edge of the Sawtooth National Forest, near the turnoff to the Elkhorn Pass. A few miles later, they rounded Dollar Mountain, where a green oasis appeared, nestled among the brown slopes. Here amid the lacy pines and shimmering aspens lay Sun Valley, the mountains&#x2019; most fabled resort, where Ernest Hemingway began writing <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls, </i>where Olympic skiers and skaters had long made their second home. <br><br>The tide of families they were joining this Tuesday afternoon all had some connection to Allen &amp; Co., a boutique investment bank that specialized in the media and communications industries. Allen &amp; Co. had put together some of the biggest mergers in Hollywood, and for more than a decade had been hosting an annual series of discussions and seminars mingled with outdoor recreation at Sun Valley for its clients and friends. Herbert Allen, the firm&#x2019;s CEO, invited only people he liked, or those with whom he was at least willing to do business. <br><br>Thus the conference was always filled with faces both famous and rich: Hollywood producers and stars like Candice Bergen, Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and Sydney Pollack; entertainment moguls like Barry Diller, Rupert Murdoch, Robert Iger, and Michael Eisner; socially pedigreed journalists like Tom Brokaw, Diane Sawyer, and Charlie Rose; and technology titans like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Andy Grove. A pack of reporters lay in wait for them every year outside the Sun Valley Lodge. <br><br>The reporters had traveled a day earlier to the Newark, New Jersey, airport or some similar embarkation point to board a commercial flight to Salt Lake City, then raced to Concourse E&#x2019;s bullpen to sit amid a crush of people waiting for flights to places like Casper, Wyoming, and Sioux City, Iowa, until it was time to cram themselves into a prop plane for the one-hour bronco ride to Sun Valley. On arrival their plane was directed to the opposite end of the airport next to the tennis-court-size terminal, where they witnessed a crew of tanned young Allen &amp; Co. employees dressed in pastel &#x201c;SV99&#x201d; polo shirts and white shorts welcoming the handful of Allen &amp; Co. guests who were arriving early on commercial flights. These were instantly recognizable among the other passengers: men in Western boots and Paul Stuart shirts with jeans, women wearing goatskin-suede jackets and marble-size turquoise beads. The Allen staff had memorized the newcomers&#x2019; faces from photographs supplied in advance. They hugged people they had gotten to know in years past as if they were old friends, whisked away all the guests&#x2019; bags, and led their charges off to the SUVs lined up steps away in the parking lot. <br><br>The reporters went to the rental-car desk, then drove to the Lodge, by now acutely conscious of their lowly status. For the next few days, many areas of Sun Valley would be marked as &#x201c;private,&#x201d; blocked from prying eyes by closed doors, omnipresent security, hanging flower baskets, and large potted plants. The reporters would lurk around the fringes, excluded from the interesting things going on inside, noses pressed against the bushes. [1] Ever since Disney&#x2019;s Michael Eisner and Capital Cities/ABC&#x2019;s Tom Murphy had dreamed up a deal to merge their companies at Sun Valley &#x2019;95 (the way the conference was often referred to&#x2013;as if it had engulfed the entire resort, which, in a way, it had), the press coverage had grown until it took on the artificially giddy atmosphere of a business version of Cannes. The mergers that splintered off from Sun Valley, however, were only occasional calves from an iceberg. Sun Valley was about more than making deals, though the deals garnered most of the press. Every year the rumors sizzled that this company or that was working on a deal at the mysterious conclave in the Idaho mountains. Thus, as the SUVs rolled one by one into the porte cochere, the reporters peered through the front windows to see who was inside. When someone newsworthy arrived, they chased their prey into the lodge, brandishing cameras and microphones. <br><br>The press quickly recognized Warren Buffett as he stepped out of his SUV. &#x201c;The DNA of the conference had him built into it,&#x201d; said his friend Don Keough, chairman of Allen &amp; Co. [2] Most of the press people liked Buffett, who went out of his way not to be disliked by anyone. He also intrigued them. His public image was that of a simple man, and he seemed genuine. Yet he lived a complicated life. He owned five homes but occupied only two of them. Somehow he had wound up having, in effect, two wives. He spoke in homely aphorisms with a kindly twinkle in his eye and had a notably loyal group of friends, yet along the way he had earned a reputation as a tough, even icy dealmaker. He seemed to shun publicity yet managed to attract more of it than almost any other businessman on earth. [3] He jetted around the country in a G-IV, often attended celebrity events, and had many famous friends, yet said that he preferred Omaha, hamburgers, and thrift. He spoke of his success as being based on a few simple investing ideas and tap-dancing to work with enthusiasm every day, but if that was so, why had nobody else been able to replicate it? <br><br>Buffett, as always, gave the photographers a willing wave and a grandfatherly smile as he walked by. They captured him on film, then began peering at the next car. <br><br>The Buffetts drove around to their French-country-style condominium, one of the coveted Wildflower group next to the pool and tennis courts, where Herbert Allen housed his VIPs. Inside, the usual loot awaited them: a pile of Allen &amp; Co. SV99 logo jackets, baseball caps, zip fleeces, polo shirts&#x2013;every year a different color&#x2013;and a zippered notebook. Despite his fortune of more than $30 billion&#x2013;enough to buy a thousand of those G-IVs parked out at the airport&#x2013;Buffett liked few things more than getting a...</p><h2>Women and Desire: Beyond Wanting to Be Wanted</h2><p>An internationally recognized Jungian analyst and psychologist helps women reclaim true desire for themselves. Not since Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex has female desire been explored so deeply and provocatively.<br><br>This groundbreaking book delves into the complex world of female desire where women simply "want to be wanted." Many women encourage others to identify or validate images that give them feelings of worth or vitality and then feel resentful because they have sacrificed their real needs and desires. Instead of knowing who they really are and what they would like to do with their lives, they become trapped in their images. As a result, self-direction, self-confidence, and self-determination are undermined from adolescence through old age.<br><br>Dr. Polly Young-Eisendrath examines this damaging syndrome of female development, showing women, and girls, how to untangle themselves from the web of reflected images that confuses or conceals their authentic wants and needs. Women and Desire empowers women to understand and take control of their sexual, social, and spiritual lives.</p><p>"This beautifully conceived book speaks to women who feel stretched between their desire to be loved and their desire to fulfill their own personal identity. One path, they believe, requires sacrificing the other.

Organized thematically and featuring paintings, drawings, prints, photographs and sculpture, the publication brings together some of the Museum&#x2019;s most celebrated masterworks, contextualizing them across mediums and amidst lesser-seen but revelatory works. The selection of works by artists such as Edward Hopper, Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe, Charles Sheeler, Charles Burchfield and Stuart Davis includes urban and rural landscapes, scenes of industry, still-life compositions and portraiture. Although varying in style and specifics, they share certain underlying visual and emotional tendencies. Cityscapes and factories are shown eerily emptied of the crush of residents that flocked to them, becoming both a celebration of clean modern forms and technological advances, as in Sheeler&#x2019;s paintings and photographs, and a reflection of anxiety about increasingly urban lifestyles and their consequences for the American individual, as in Hopper&#x2019;s iconic &#x201c;Night Windows.&#x201d; Equally silent rural scenes are no less haunting, but perhaps reflect a nostalgia for seemingly simpler times, and a celebration of early American traditions and values. Featured still lifes are as diverse: Stuart Davis&#x2019; bright, angular compositions marry fractured form with logos and patterns taken from modern advertising, while Charles Demuth&#x2019;s rich watercolors of fruits and vegetables celebrate agricultural bounty and his mastery of the medium. Works by Arthur Dove, Alfred Stieglitz and Andrew Wyeth, among others, suggest different possibilities in portraiture, and the diverse ways artists have thought about the figure and its absence as a way to capture their subject. This volume is a focused look at the strengths and surprises of MoMA&#x2019;s collection in an area that has played a rich and major role in the institution&#x2019;s history.</p><p>American modernism in the years before Abstract Expressionism is the focus of this exhibition, featuring iconic works from MoMA's collection by Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keeffe, George Bellows.

Feynman (1918 1988) physicist, teacher, author, and cultural icon. His autobiographies and biographies have been read and enjoyed by millions of readers around the world, while his wit and eccentricities have made him the subject of TV specials and even a theatrical film. The spectacular reception of the book and audio versions of Feynman's <i>Six Easy Pieces</i> (published in 1995) resulted in a worldwide clamor for More Feynman! More Feynman!&#x201d; The outcome is these six additional lectures, drawn from the celebrated three-volume <i>Lectures on Physics</i>. Though slightly more challenging than the first six, these lectures are more focused, delving into the most revolutionary discovery in twentieth-century physics: Einstein's Theory of Relativity. No single breakthrough in twentieth-century physics (with the possible exception of quantum mechanics) changed our view of the world more than that of Einstein's discovery of relativity. The notions that the flow of time is not a constant, that the mass of an object depends on its velocity, and that the speed of light is a constant no matter what the motion of the observer, at first seemed shocking to scientists and laymen alike. But, as Feynman shows so clearly and so entertainingly in the lectures chosen for this volume, these crazy notions are no mere dry principles of physics, but are things of beauty and elegance. No one not even Einstein himself explained these difficult, anti-intuitive concepts more clearly, or with more verve and gusto, than Richard Feynman.</p><p><b>Richard P. Feynman</b> was raised in Far Rockaway, New York, and received his Ph.D. from Princeton. He held professorships at both Cornell and the California Institute of Technology. In 1965 he received the Nobel Prize for his work on quantum electrodynamics. He died in 1988.</p><h2>These High, Green Hills (Mitford Years)</h2><p>Mitford rector Father Tim faces the new challenges of matirmony after he marries his vivacious Cynthia, from the trials and tribulations of the parish&#39;s new computer, to redecorating the rectory, to his dog&#39;s new sleeping arrangements. Reprint.</p><p>The village of Mitford is soothing tonic for a readership that feels starved for community and yearns for clear morals. The recently married Father Tim and his plain-folk neighbors live the best of Christianity in everyday life. Even the rampant gossip in Mitford is the good kind: folks worrying about other folks and everyone minding one another's business out of concern rather than malice. As a result, no one faces a crisis alone. Often the crises are cause for a belly laugh, such as the rectory's new computer system that seems programmed to torment. But just as often the crises have the bite of real-life problems, such as the bloody young girl in shredded clothes, whom Father Tim finds after she was beaten by her drunken father, and the soul-wrenching despair Father Tim feels when he loses a surrogate mother. The heavily quoted scripture gives a day-to-day context for biblical teachings as well as spiritual solace during the sadder days at Mitford. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Jan Karon was born in Lenoir, North Carolina, in 1937 ("A great year for the Packard automobile," she says). Her creative skills first came alive when her family moved to a farm. "On the farm there is time to muse and dream," she says. "I am endlessly grateful I was reared in the country. As a young girl I couldn't wait to get off that farm, to go to Hollywood or New York. But living in those confined, bucolic circumstances was one of the best things that ever happened to me."<br><br>Jan knew that she wanted to be a writer, and even wrote a novel at the age of ten. Her first real opportunity as a writer came at age eighteen when she took a job as a receptionist at an ad agency. She kept leaving her writing on her boss's desk until he noticed her ability. Soon she was launched on a forty-year career in advertising. She won assignments in New York and San Francisco, numerous awards, and finally an executive position with a national agency.<br><br>Recently she left advertising to write books, and moved to Blowing Rock, North Carolina, a tiny town of 1,800 perched at 5,000 feet in the Blue Ridge mountains. "I immediately responded to the culture of village life," says Jan. "And I must say the people welcomed me. I have never felt so at home."<br><br>Blowing Rock is the model for Mitford, and the similarities are strong. "None of the people in Mitford are actually based upon anyone in Blowing Rock," says Jan. "Yet, the spirit of my characters is found throughout this real-life village. You can walk into Sonny's Grill in Blowing Rock and find the same kind of guys who hang around Mitford's Main Street Grill."<br><br>Jan is quick to assert that there are Mitfords all over the country, those hundreds of towns where readers of Jan's books cherish their own cast of eccentric and beloved characters. Currently, one of Jan's chief delights is getting to meet those readers. "Some people finish writing and open a bottle of scotch or a box of chocolates," she says. "My reward is meeting my readers face-to-face. I think an author is something like a glorified bartender. My readers tell me all kinds of things about their lives, and I get these long, long letters. I answer every one, of course."<br><br>Jan has a daughter, Candace Freeland, who is a photojournalist and musician.</p><h2>Circle Round: Raising Children In Goddess Traditions</h2><p>Harvesting the first tomato from the garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marking new and full moons.&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying grace and evening prayers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Losing the first tooth.&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are part of Goddess celebration--and this lovingly written book shows the way to share the celebration with children.<br><br>As a one-of-a-kind resource for people of many faiths and beliefs, <i>Circle Round</i> encourages us to gently open children's awareness to the sacredness of life, our connection to Mother Earth, and our responsibility to preserve Her gifts.&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when child-rearing is intensely affected by the stresses of modern life, Starhawk, Diane Baker, and Anne Hill offer new ways to foster a strong sense of family, whether that family is headed by a single parent, stepparents, same-sex parents, or loving communities of friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here then are new traditions, meaningful and symbolic, to bring to your home.<br><br>Of paramount importance in Goddess tradition is the wheel of life, the never-ending cycle of birth, growth, love, fulfillment, and death.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each turn of the wheel is presented here, in eight holidays spanning the changing seasons, in rites of passage for life transitions, and in the elements of fire, air, water, earth, and spirit as they embody ever-changing nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;And each holiday, rite, and element section is enriched with songs and rituals, step-by-step craft and cooking projects, family-oriented activities and read-aloud stories for you and your children to share.<br><br>On December's Winter Solstice try baking Wish Bread with your child, putting in hopes and dreams for the coming year.&nbsp;&nbsp;For Beltane in May you may choose to say a blessing for mothers or make an altar of flowers in bloom.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your teenager is going off to college, the Leaving Behind and Carrying With rituals may ease anxiety.&nbsp;&nbsp;Water play is important as you give your toddler a bath.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you may want to encourage your older child to grow a plant and experience firsthand the life-giving power of the earth.<br><br>Crafted with your limited free time in mind, <i>Circle Round</i> offers an array of easily adaptable material to fit your own needs and worldview.The result is a sourcebook filled with wisdom--and the hope that you will add a piece of Goddess tradition to your family's life, to honor Mother Earth and bring Her presence to your home and your children's world.</p><p>The 20th-century reclamation of Goddess traditions has evolved from a small counterculture revolution of the mid-1900s to the birthright of an entire generation of children and young teenagers. However, the parents--who were adults when they first turned to paganism--are discovering that raising children in a pagan tradition can prove difficult amidst the near void of resources to assist them in teaching this way of life. Relying on age-old learning methods, such as songs and storytelling, <i>Circle Round</i> fills this void with techniques that are truly rooted in traditions. This priceless resource offers guidelines for helping children discover the different facets of the Goddess tradition--from altars to sabbats--and suggests recipes, creative projects, and other activities resuscitating the values of family in our latchkey society. <i>--Brian Patterson</i>From the Earth to our hearts...<p></p><li> Festivals for holidays from Halloween to Fall Equinox<br></li><li> Moon and sun celebrations<br></li><li> Home altars and seasonal decorations<br></li><li> Craft projects<br></li><li> Sacred baking and recipes<br></li><li> Rituals for children and adolescents<br></li><li> Family activities for ordinary days and weekends<br></li><li> Blessings for birth and rites of passage<p></p></li></p><h2>The Flying Biscuit Cafe Cookbook: Breakfast and Beyond</h2><p>Chef April Moon&#39;s signature healthy comfort food from the legendary Flying Biscuit Cafe is captured in this cookbook. Follow her lead and let the love flow at home.</p><p></p><h2>Village Bells</h2><p>In the French canton of Brienne in November 1799, local authorities were scandalized when a crowd of girls broke through the doors of the church and rang the bells in order to mark the festival of St. Catherine. Religious use of the bells was forbidden by law, but the villagers boldly insisted on their right to celebrate with peals the feast of a beloved saint. So begins <i>Village Bells,</i> Alain Corbin's exploration of the "auditory landscape" of nineteenth-century France, a story of lost sensory experiences and forgotten passions. In the nineteenth century, these instruments were symbols of their towns and objects of both ecclesiastic and civic pride. Bell-ringing served practical purposes of communication, marking both religious and secular time, as well as calling citizens to pray, assemble, take arms, or beware of danger. As Corbin shows, the bells also reflected the social, political, and religious struggles of the time. To control the bells was to control the symbolic order, rhythm, and loyalties of French village and country life.<br><br>Using church archives and local documents, Corbin forges a unique history of the role of bells from the aftermath of the Revolution to the dawn of the twentieth century. He charts how the First Republic (1792&#x2013;1804) moved toward a more secular society, turning many bells into coins and cannonballs and seizing others as property of the state. A gradual return to the religious use of bells occurred in the nineteenth century, even as their new secular roles were maintained. Corbin describes the battles over the marking of religious versus secular time, as calls to prayer, the celebration of religious feasts, and the marking of rites of passage&#x2015;baptism, marriage, and death&#x2015;competed with tolls indicating the passing hours or marking assemblies, elections, or republican holidays.<br><br>Thoroughly documented and recounted with intriguing narratives, <i>Village Bells</i> provides an original approach to nineteenth-century French cultural, social, and political history. As Corbin notes, the bells are no longer essential to our lives&#x2015;their qualitative, sacred time and space replaced by the quantitative, secular measures of the clock&#x2015;but by understanding their lost symbolic and practical importance we open a window onto the age in which they rang.</p><p>Since the Renaissance, France has been known as the country of ringing towns. By the 19th century, according to Alain Corbin, a renowned professor of contemporary history at the Sorbonne, a French village community could not live without its bells. Village peals were symbols and objects of both ecclesiastic and civic pride, and played such an integral role in town life that, according to Corbin, community leaders frequently allocated more money to their acquisition and maintenance than to relieving poverty or promoting education. Bell-ringing not only served practical purposes of communication, it also reflected the social, political, and religious struggles of the time. To control the bells was to control the symbolic order, rhythm, and loyalties of French village and country life. Furthermore, Corbin argues, possessing a peal of bells was a prerequisite of modernity in a society increasingly subject to haste but as yet without any other means of transmitting information instantaneously. Examinations of the social imagination have traditionally neglected materials pertaining to auditory perception, making Corbin's exploration of his thesis all the more original. <i>--Bertina Loeffler</i>A story of lost sensory experiences and forgotten passions, the latest work from renowned historian Alain Corbin recounts the history of nineteenth-century French rural life through the countryside&#39;s numerous bells.</p><h2>Isaiah 56-66: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (Anchor Bible)</h2><p><p>The world&#x2019;s leading authority on the prophet Isaiah brings his distinguished three-volume commentary on the book of Isaiah to a conclusion with this new translation and critical discussion of the final eleven chapters.<br><br>The concluding section of the book of Isaiah, sometimes referred to as Third or Trito Isaiah, had a profound impact on the Christian movement in its formative phase, including such central issues as the identity of the founder, the profile of the disciple, and the Gentile mission. In this thorough and informative commentary, Joseph Blenkinsopp shows that while these chapters maintain continuity with Second Isaiah, they must be considered in the light of a new set of circumstances. <br>The texts present a community beset by severe problems, attempting to cope with disappointed expectations and trying to maintain its faith in the reality, power, and benevolence of the God of traditional religion. Blenkinsopp discusses in detail the issues that divide the community, from concerns about the efficacy of religious practices (prayer, fasting, Sabbath observance, and sacrifice) to questions about who may claim the name of Israelite and under what conditions, to what kind of relations should be maintained with outsiders. In examining each of these topics, Blenkinsopp shows that they provide evidence of an emerging Judaism seeking its own identity and self-definition and testify to the existence of a prophetic discipleship inspired by the person and teaching of the charismatic servant whose fate is described in the previous section of Isaiah.<br>Reflecting the same standard of excellence as Blenkinsopp&#x2019;s first two volumes on Isaiah, this is an important contribution to the prestigious Anchor Bible Commentary series. <br><b></b></p></p><p><p>JOSEPH BLENKINSOPP is currently the John A.

They perfected a style which was less naturalistic than that later employed by the Greeks and Romans but which is particularly fascinating to the modern eye because of its combination of realistic and symbolic elements. This book aims to help the reader to such an understanding, concentrating particularly on points that may puzzle the modern western viewer. The principles of representation underlying Egyptian art, which differ fundamentally from western conventions rooted in perspective, are elucidated and the materials and methods used by the artists described. Of great importance was the technique of drawing a squared grid over the surface to be decorated, and the use of this grid system as an aid for obtaining correct proportions is explained, together with its influence on the composition of whole scenes. A chapter is devoted to the fascinating and highly individual work produced during the reign of the heretic king Akhenaten.</p><p>Dr <b>Gay Robins</b> studied Egyptology at the University of Durham as an undergraduate and then went to Oxford to undertake research on queens of the Eighteenth Dynasty, obtaining a DPhil in 1981.

Somehow we have managed to lose sight of the prime directive given to us by Jesus to go and make disciples of all the nations. There is hope. We can still fulfill the great commission in this generation, but we will need to get back the power that spread the gospel across the globe in the first century. We will need to see multiplication of disciples occur among all those in the church. Cultivating a Life for God takes an in-depth look at a tool called Life Transformation Groups and explains how this tool can release the awesome power of multiplication in your Church.</p><p>Neil Cole is an experienced church planter and pastor.

It will become the benchmark for every other work on the subject, present or future. The Zaleskis' massive scholarship, catholicity of interests, and clarity of presentation make this a volume to hold close to both the heart and the head." -- Phyllis Tickle, author of The Divine Hours<br><br>This landmark book presents prayer in all its richness and variety throughout history, across traditions, and around the globe. Focusing on extraordinary stories of lives changed by prayer and on great works of literature and art inspired by it, Philip and Carol Zaleski map the vast world of prayer from the sacred pipe to the rosary, from Paleolithic cave art to Pentecostal revivals. They reveal the fascinating experiences of such great and sometimes surprising figures as Emily Dickinson, Bill W., Teresa of �vila, Mohandas K. Gandhi, Samuel Johnson, and J.R.R. Tolkien.<br><br>Examining prayer as petition, thanksgiving, adoration, contemplation, ecstasy, magic, and sacrifice, the Zaleskis probe the language of prayer, the fruits of prayer, its controversies, and its prospects for the future.<br><br>Prayer is an informative, accessible, and entertaining narrative that will appeal to an audience of all faiths. The Zaleskis have created a work that will be the standard for years to come.<br><br>Philip Zaleski is the editor of the Best American Spiritual Writing series, author of The Recollected Heart, and coeditor, with Carol Zaleski, of The Book of Heaven.

She contributes a monthly column to Christian Century and is a professor of religion at Smith College.<br>"Prayer: A History is not only a fabulous, very readable, immensely informative and (I would even say) 'inspirational' volume. It is, to my mind, simply unmatched in the vast literature on what lies, after all, at the heart of the religious life. The Zaleskis range over history (even prehistory), art, literature, theology, and comparative religion -- a real tour de force. But throughout, they engage any reader -- specialist or not -- and never flaunt their impressive learning. They help us understand the unending human quest for meaning at its deepest level." -- Harvey Cox<br><br>"Prayer is simply a wonderful book -- intelligent, beautifully written, important, inclusive, and completely useful. I wish every world leader would read it word for word today. We'd all be better for it. Carol and Philip Zaleski have been making extraordinary contributions to religion and spirituality for many years, and now they have outdone themselves." -- Thomas Moore, author of Care of the Soul<br><br>"Everybody prays. Whether with faith-filled discipline or in the unanticipated aspiration, prompted by despair or ecstasy, calling out to the Unknown, everybody prays. Everybody who is serious about prayer will be grateful to the Zaleskis for this inspired and inspiring book." -- Reverend Richard John Neuhaus, editor in chief of First Things</p><p>No BioChapter 1 The Foundations of Prayer<br><br>The story of prayer is the story of the impossible: of how we creatures of flesh and blood lay siege to heaven, speak to the Maker of all things, and await, with confidence or hopeful skepticism, a response. The story of prayer, like that of all treasure sought through the centuries, is rich in myth and dream, revelation and tragedy, secret maps and elusive clues. Here the absurd and the sublime sit side by side, while the fantastic and the banal merge. Consider the following: A dear friend of ours, a native Tibetan, returned last month from a visit to his homeland in the high plateau region of Gelok, far east of Lhasa. Dechen arrived in Massachusetts haggard but smiling, red Tibetan mud still clinging to his yellow Gore-Tex jacket, bearing with him harrowing tales of vicious customs officials, of torrential rains and deadly mudslides, of uncharted mountain passes and hidden valleys thick with wildflowers. At a welcome-home dinner, he and his wife set up a projector, and we spent the next few hours poring over his slides. Everyone marveled at the herds of Tibetan yaks, their shaggy coats and gracile horns so reminiscent of the prehistoric beasts in the Lascaux caves; at the crowds of Buddhist monks lighting bonfires or blowing impossibly long horns, looking for all the world like Lascaux shepherds transported to a Himalayan castle in the clouds. This was the Tibet of legend, far from the tourist hotels of Dharamsala, an area until recently forbidden to outsiders and still unvisited by television, pollution, and indoor plumbing. Bringing out an atlas, we asked Dechen to trace his journey. His finger landed on a bare white area as large as Massachusetts, a true terra incognita at the dawn of the third millennium. It reminded us of Victorian maps of sub-Saharan Africa, of ancient mariners sailing off the edge of the world. No one goes there,&#x201d; Dechen said. Too difficult. Too far.&#x201d; No one, that is, except a handful of Chinese soldiers and bureaucrats, who have done their best over the past quarter of a century to suppress one of the world&#x2019;s great religions. Only in the past few years have the monasteries been rebuilt in a curious Sino-Tibetan architectural idiom whose bright pastels and wedding-cake fa�ades threaten to create a new form of Buddhist kitsch.<br> One photograph in particular caught our fancy, for it seemed to capture best the spirit of these eastern Tibetans. It depicted a wooden framework, looming above the tallest monk (and the Tibetans are a tall people), and consisting of two massive uprights of rough-hewn lumber supporting four long crossbars. Upon each crossbar stood nine or ten prayer wheels, each containing a bit of paper inscribed with the traditional Buddhist prayer om mani padme h&#x16b;m (Hail to the Jewel in the Lotus). As the wind blows down the mountainside, each wheel spins madly, and the mantra is flung into the universe like a message in a bottle, drifting on celestial currents until it reaches its heavenly destination. Of what, we asked, were these glistening wheels made? At a glance they seemed carved from crystal or jade, or were they globes of delicate blown glass? Oh, no,&#x201d; Dechen explained, refocusing the slide projector for a better look: the wheels were nothing more than cast-off plastic Pepsi-Cola bottles.<br> This Tibetan fantasia is a portal into a number of truths about the world of prayer: that wherever one finds humans, one finds humans at prayer; that in times of persecution, prayer goes underground, where it continues to wend its course into the depths of the soul; and that any and all objects Pepsi-Cola bottles as surely as enameled statues, jeweled rosaries, or silvered icons can be a means of prayer. These jerry-built praying devices demonstrate, too, that technology and prayer that is to say, applied science and applied religion need not war with one another. The same evening, Dechen&#x2019;s wife brought out for our inspection an array of homemade prayer wheels: one turned by hand, a second by wind, and a third a particularly cunning device in the form of a lampshade spun in convection currents emitted by the heat of a hundred- watt light bulb. The Dalai Lama is on record as approving an even more technically advanced method for making a prayer wheel: download the om mani padme h&#x16b;m mantra to your computer&#x2019;s hard drive, where it will spin at a rate of some fifty-four hundred rotations per minute, calling forth the blessings of Avaloki te&#x15b;vara, the bodhisattva of compassion, as effectively as do the older technologies of prayer.<br> Dechen&#x2019;s videotapes, which we watched after the slides, demonstrated a yet larger truth about prayer: that it alterss the face of the world, revealing unnoticed harmonies and symmetries and knitting together the natural and social dimensions of ouur existence.... As the souvenir footage unreeled, we saw prayer wheels spinning in the sun, bees looping and swirling around those wheels, the sun melting into night as the monks&#x2019; voices faded into the mountains, all seemingly one motion, one symphony, one grand universal gesture of prayer. Viewed from a perspective that we may call religious but that in truth seems synonymous with human consciousness, it appeared, for just a moment, as if the entire world was collaborating in prayer.<br> There is, as Dechen&#x2019;s adventure suggests, nothing strange about prayer erupting in the oddest of circumstances. We might even say that it thrives on paradox. Consider this: that prayer deals in eternal truth and yet has its fads and fashions: a hundred years ago, revival tents sprang up from coast to coast to house the inspired preaching of Christian witnesses who passed the torch of the Second Great Awakening to twentieth-century evangelicalism; fifty years ago, FDR led the nation in prayer through the static-charged speakers of a million Sylvania radios; twenty-five years ago, school days often began with a silent meditation; now, at the beginning of the third millennium, football fields and corporate boardrooms have been favored arenas of prayer. Or this: that we pray for worldly goods but also pray for freedom from the desire for worldly goods. Or this: that we seldom pray for prayer itself. Who but a saint prays for better prayer or, God forbid, for more time to pray?<br> What, then, is this paradoxical action that we call prayer? Ask a team of scholars that question and expect a confusion of tongues in response. You may even hear a curse, for what is God damn it!&#x201d; but a perverse petition to the Almighty? But sooner or later our learned company will arrive at something like this: prayer is action that communicates between human and divine realms.<br> That is to say: Prayer is speech, but much richer than speech alone. It is a peculiar kind of speech that acts, and a peculiar kind of action that speaks to the depths and heights of being. Much of the time, prayer seems to be nothing but talk: praising, cajoling, or pleading with God; sending messages to guardian angels or tutelary spirits; appealing to benevolent cosmic powers. But to pray is also to act. Think of what happens when a child recites her nighttime prayer:<br><br>Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.<br>If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.<br><br>This prayer constitutes more than a sweet set of words. It sets events in motion; it puts God and the angels on alert. It affects the child, too, body and soul; anyone who has recited bedtime prayers as a child knows their value as a guarantor of a night&#x2019;s sound sleep.<br> Prayer is at once spiritual and visceral: it stems from heart and gut as well as head. Prayer is a state of being when we pray, we are in prayer,&#x201d; and when we communicate with spiritual beings, we are in communion&#x201d; with them but prayer is also emphatically a state of becoming, a dynamic movement, an incursion into spiritual realms: in the Trappist monk Thomas Merton&#x2019;s words, a raid on the unspeakable.&#x201d; Prayer has been compared to a siege, a storm, a conflagration, a nosegay, a picnic in paradise. We may also liken it to an athletic event, such as the hurling of a javelin: a shaft of praise, petition, or penance aimed at a higher power. Like the javelin thrower, those who pray must be fit: Whoso will pray, he must fast and be clean / And fat his soul, and make his body lean&#x201d; (Geoffrey Chaucer, The Somnour&#x2019;s Tale&#x201d;). And those who pray must try their hardest, so that prayer can make them fit: That prayer has great power which a person makes with all his might. It makes a sour heart sweet, a sad heart merry, a poor heart rich, a foolish heart wise, a timid heart brave, a sick heart well, a blind heart full of sight, a cold heart ardent&#x201d; (Mechtild of Magdeburg, Revelations).1 Conventional wisdom divides prayer into a number of categories: petition, confession, adoration, sacrifice, intercession, contemplation, thanksgiving, vows, and so on. But these classifications disguise the complexity of the world of prayer. Consider an archetypal prayer of petition, one so commonplace that it has been lampooned in countless cartoons and comic strips: a plea to God to change the weather. What could be more simple and straightforward? But let us examine the evidence: Among the Papago (Tohono O&#x2019;odham) of the American Southwest, rainmaking lies at the heart of ritual life. These Indians inhabit a landscape of sagebrush and lava rock, dry mesas and desert valleys; without the downpours of the rainy season, crops would wither and famine ensue. To ensure an annual harvest, each year the people gather to sing down the rain. &#x201d;Much of what scholars know about this seemingly quixotic practice comes from Ruth Murray Underhill (1884 1984), an anthropologist from Columbia University who lived among the Papago in the 1930s and later wrote a number of classic studies of American Indians, including Papago Woman, the first published life of a Southwestern Indian woman. Underhill was a special kind of researcher, more passionate participant than dispassionate observer: I met these hard-working but poetic Papagos,&#x201d; she writes, and fell permanently in love with them.&#x201d;2 Her description of the Papago as poetic is more than anthropological romanticism; poetry for these Indians is a matter of life or death because through their verse they bring down the rain. Each year in an act of communal supplication they sing:<br><br>Come together!<br><br>You shall see this thing which we have always done And what must truly happen.<br>Because we have planned it thus and thus have done.<br>Right soon, indeed, it will happen.<br>It will rain.<br>The fields will be watered.<br>Therein we shall drop the seed.<br>Seed which bears corn of all colors; Seed which grows big.<br>Thus we shall do.<br>Thereby we shall feed ourselves; Thereby our stomachs shall grow big; Thereby we shall live.3<br><br>Such prayer songs bring the Papago into union with I&#x2019;itoi, First Brother, who prepared the world for people at the beginning of time and who is instrumental in bringing the rain. But chant alone is insufficient. Each year Papago women also collect the red, pear-shaped fruit of the giant cactus Cereus giganteus and ferment it into a jellylike wine (Underhill says that it tastes like spoiled raspberry jam&#x201d;), which is consumed in a community tahiwua k-ii (Sit-and- drink) that along with singing ensures the coming of the rain. This is action by analogy: as the people are filled with liquor, so will the earth fill with rain. An elder calls:<br><br>Hurry! Hither bring, each of you, his syrup.<br>Soon we shall make liquor!<br>Soon it will ferment, Soon we shall drink, Soon it will rain.4<br><br>The people sing:<br><br>Now here you have assembled; Now thus we shall do!<br>With our singing we shall pull down the rain.5<br><br> Sure enough: within a few days of the Sit-and-drink witnessed by Underhill, the skies opened and the drenching rains of July descended. The clouds come because we call them,&#x201d; explained a Papago, and we call them with the drinking.&#x201d; The rainmaking ritual ensures not only the watering of crops but also the stability of the world. Ofelia Zepeda, a Papago linguist, recalls her mother&#x2019;s belief that if the ceremony were to be neglected or the prayers forgotten, the world will ruin itself.&#x201d; Alas, in these amnesiac times aspects of the rite have been discarded or lost, but the prayers, at least for the moment, remain. As a result,&#x201d; Zepeda comments dryly, the world is somewhat intact today.&#x201d;6 Let us contrast this example of traditional rainmaking with a more urbane tale of weather manipulation set in the waning months of World War II. It is December 1944: the U.S. Third Army surges toward the Rhine. But General George S. Patton Jr. is troubled, for a drenching rain, with no sign of letup, threatens his brilliant advance. On December 14, he summons to his office deputy chief of staff Colonel Paul D. Hawkins and Chaplain O&#x2019;Neill of the Third Army. The following conversation ensues:<br><br>General Patton: Chaplain, I want you to publish a prayer for good weather. I&#x2019;m tired of these soldiers having to fight mud and floods as well as Germans. See if we can&#x2019;t get God to work on our side.<br><br>Chaplain O&#x2019;Neill: Sir, it&#x2019;s going to take a pretty thick rug for that kind of praying.<br><br>General Patton: I don&#x2019;t care if it takes the flying carpet. I want the praying done.<br><br>Chaplain O&#x2019;Neill: Yes, sir. May I say, General, that it usually isn&#x2019;t a customary thing among men of my profession to pray for clear weather to kill fellow men.<br><br>General Patton: Chaplain, are you teaching me theology or are you the Chaplain of the Third Army? I want a prayer.<br><br>Chaplain O&#x2019;Neill: Yes, sir.7<br><br>According to Hawkins, who annotated Patton&#x2019;s blustery 1947 memoir, War as I Knew It, the general got his wish. The following prayer was printed and distributed to every soldier in the U.S. Third Army:<br><br>Almighty and most merciful Father, we humbly beseech Thee, of Thy great goodness, to restrain these immoderate rains with which we have had to contend. Grant us fair weather for Battle. Graciously hearken to us as soldiers who call upon Thee that, armed with Thy power, we may advance from victory to victory, and crush the oppression and wickedness of our enemies, and establish Thy justice among men and nations. Amen.8 <br><br> The skies cleared within twenty-four hours. A week of perfect weather ensued, allowing the Allies to advance toward the Rhine. Patton was ecstatic. Summoning Hawkins to his office, he declared, God damn! Look at the weather. That O&#x2019;Neill sure did some potent praying. Get him up here. I want to pin a medal on him.&#x201d; The next day, the somewhat abashed Chaplain O&#x2019;Neill received the Bronze Star.9 Both Patton and the Papago prayed to change the weather, but there the similarities end. Patton made his prayer to the biblical God, while the Papago, in Underhill&#x2019;s words, call upon the powers of Nature.&#x201d; Patton&#x2019;s prayer was composed on the spot by a harassed army chaplain, whereas Papago prayers originate with I&#x2019;itoi, a supernatural being. Patton&#x2019;s was a prayer for victory and thus indirectly for death to the opposition ( to crush the . . . wickedness of our enemies&#x201d;), whereas the Papago sing for the life of the corn and thus of the people. Most important, Papago prayer unfolds within a traditional culture steeped in daily intercourse between natural and supernatural realms, one that affirms, beyond any doubt, that singing down the rain&#x201d; accomplishes just what it claims to do. Patton, by contrast, issued his prayer amidst the crumbling monuments of Christendom. His petition swims with irony. The general was a devout Christian, and there seems no reason to doubt that he believed God could and perhaps would stop the rain. He was, however, also a canny man, surely aware that in modern times the notion of altering the weather through prayer ...</p><h2>Making Miniature Oriental Rugs &amp; Carpets</h2><p>Aimed at dolls&#39; house enthusiasts, keen needlepoint stitchers and connoisseurs of fine carpets, this collection of miniaturized oriental carpet designs contains 25 designs shown in full colour photographs and 1:12 scale colour charts.

Last night she'd told Norman she might sleep all day just to catch up. No kids for once, no demands, no responsibilities. But the noise. What was it, a truck, a bus? It sounded so close. And then the empty sound after the engine cut off. She'd never get back to sleep now. She slipped into her robe, the one the children had given her for Mother's Day. "Daddy picked it out," Jen had said. "Do you like it?" "Oh yes, it's perfect," Sandy had answered, hating it. Imagine Norman choosing the same robe for her as she had sent to his mother and her own. </p><p> She traipsed across the room to the window, rubbing her eyes to keep them open, spitting her hair out of her face. She looked down into the wooded backyard. He was in front of the crab apple tree, hands on hips, as if waiting for her, dressed in a white bed sheet and a stars and stripes helmet, standing next to a motorcycle. What was this? A kid, playing Halloween? A neighborhood ghost? No...look...he threw off the bed sheet and stood before her, naked, his penis long and stiff. Sandy dropped to her knees, barely peeking out the window afraid, but fascinated, not just by the act itself, but by the style. So fast, so hard! Didn't it hurt, handling it that way? She'd always been so careful with Norman's, scared that she might damage it. Who was he? What was he doing in her yard? <i>Nineteen, twenty, twenty-one,</i> Sandy counted. He came on twenty-seven, leaving his stuff on her lawn, then jumped on his bike, kicked down with one foot, and started up the engine. But wait. It stalled. Would she have to call Triple A and if so how was she going to explain the problem? <i>Hello, this is Mrs. Pressman there's a...you see...well...anyway and he's having trouble with his motorcycle...</i> No. No need to worry. The engine caught and he took off, zooming down the street, wearing only the stars and stripes helmet. </p><p> She called Norman first, at the plant, and he asked, "Did it make ridges in the lawn?" </p><p> "What?" </p><p> "The motorcycle, did it make ridges in the lawn?" </p><p> "I don't know." </p><p> "Well, find out." </p><p> "Now?" </p><p> "Yes, I'll hold." </p><p> She put the phone down and ran outside. </p><p> "Yes, there are ridges," she told Norman. "Two of them." </p><p> "Okay. First thing, call Rufano, tell him to take care of it." </p><p> "Right. Rufano," she repeated, jotting it down. "Should he reseed or what?" </p><p> "I can't say. I'm not there, am I? Let him decide, he's the doctor." </p><p> "But it doesn't pay to put money into the lawn when we're moving, does it?" </p><p> "We haven't sold the house yet. it would be different if we'd already sold." </p><p> "Norm..." </p><p> "What?" </p><p> "I'm a little shaky." </p><p> "I'll call the police as soon as we hang tip." </p><p> "I'm not dressed." </p><p> "So get dressed." </p><p> "Are you coming home?" </p><p> "I can't, Sandy. I'm in the middle of a new solution." </p><p> "Oh." </p><p> "See you tonight." </p><p> "Right." </p><p> Sandy showered and dressed and waited for the police.<br> </p><p> "Okay, Mrs. Pressman, let's have it again." She'd expected, at the very least, Columbo. Instead she got Hubanski, tall and thin, with a missing tooth and an itchy leg. He sat on the sofa and scratched the area above his black anklet sock. Plainfield, New Jersey's, finest. </p><p> "My husband told you the whole story, didn't he?" </p><p> "Uh huh." </p><p> He whipped his notebook out of his pocket and made squiggles with his ballpoint pen. "Doesn't seem to be working today." </p><p> "Try blowing in it," Sandy suggested. "Sometimes that helps." </p><p> Hubanski blew into the end of his ballpoint and tried again. "Nope, nothing." </p><p> "Just a minute." Sandy went into the kitchen and came back with a pen. "Try this one." </p><p> "Thanks," he said, printing his name. </p><p> Sandy sat down on the love seat opposite. him, tucking her legs under her. </p><p> "Okay, now I want to hear it from you, Mrs. Pressman. You say it was about quarter past eight?" </p><p> "No, quarter to." </p><p> "You're sure of that?" </p><p> "Yes, positive, because as soon as I woke up I looked at the clock." </p><p> "And the noise that woke you sounded like a motorcycle?" </p><p> "Well, I didn't know it was a motorcycle then. I just knew it was a noise, which is why I went over to the window in the first place." </p><p> "Now, we have to be very sure about this, Mrs. Pressman." </p><p> "I looked out the window and there he was," Sandy said. "It's very simple." </p><p> "He didn't ring the bell or anything, first?" </p><p> "Why would he have done that?" </p><p> "I'm only trying to set the record straight, Mrs. Pressman, because, you know, this isn't our everyday, ordinary kind of complaint. So just take your time and tell me again." </p><p> "He was wearing a sheet and he was looking up at me." </p><p> "Now, this here's the important part, Mrs. Pressman, and I want to be sure I've got it one hundred per cent right. You're telling me that this guy rides up on a motorcycle." </p><p> "Yes. </p><p> "And he's got a bed sheet over him." </p><p> "That's right." </p><p> "Like your ordinary everyday kind of bed sheet?" </p><p> "Yes, plain white, hospital variety." </p><p> "Okay, I get the picture. So let's take it from there, Mrs. Pressman. Now, you look down from your bedroom window and he looks up. Is that right so far?" </p><p> "Very good, you're doing fine." </p><p> "Look, Mrs. Pressman, you might not believe it, but this is no picnic for me either." </p><p> "Sorry. </p><p> "Okay, so he takes off the sheet." </p><p> "Right." </p><p> "And he's stark naked." </p><p> "Yes, except for his helmet...stars and stripes..." </p><p> "Yeah, I already got that. So, go on." </p><p> "Well, then he masturbated. And that's about it." </p><p> "You say <i>about.</i> Is there something else?" </p><p> "No, he got on his motorcycle and rode off. That's it." </p><p> "Naked?" </p><p> "Yes, I told you that." </p><p> "So where's the bed sheet, Mrs. Pressman?" He held up his hand, a hint of a smile showing on his face for the first time. </p><p> "I don't know." </p><p> "You didn't pick it up when you went out to inspect the lawn?" </p><p> "No." </p><p> "And you didn't see him pick it up either?" </p><p> "No, but he might have. Because I was pretty upset at the time, as you can imagine. I might have missed that." </p><p> "What I don't get, Mrs. Pressman, is how come you watched the whole thing. I mean, you could have called us right off. We might have been able to get over here in time." </p><p> "I was scared, I guess. I just don't know," </p><p> "How about a make on the motorcycle?" </p><p> "It was chrome." </p><p> "Come on, Mrs. Pressman. You can do better than that. Was it this year's model, a 1970? Or would you say it was five to ten years old?" </p><p> "I don't know. They all look the same to me." </p><p> He clicked the pen closed, stood up, and handed it to Sandy. </p><p> "Keep it," she said, "I'm sure you'll need it." </p><p> "Thanks. Say listen, what about the dog? Your husband said you have a dog." </p><p> "We do, a miniature schnauzer, Banushka. But he slept through it." </p><p> "You're sure he was white?" </p><p> "Who?" </p><p> "The guy -- the exhibitionist." </p><p> "Oh, yes." </p><p> "Because a lot of these mixed races can look almost white." </p><p> "No, he was white. Like you." </p><p> He sighed. "Well, you haven't given me much to go on, Mrs. Pressman." </p><p> "I'm sorry." </p><p> "Look, if you remember anything else, no matter how small, give me a call, okay? And in the meantime I'll do my best." </p><p> "That's all anyone can ask for, sergeant..." Sandy paused. What the hell was his name? </p><p> "Hubanski. U-ban-ski. The H is silent." </p><p> "I'll remember that. Good-bye...and thank you." </p><p> As Hubanski was walking down the front steps Sandy called, "Oh, sergeant?" </p><p> He turned. "Yeah." </p><p> "I just remembered...he was left-handed."<br> </p><p> "Hubanski didn't believe me," she told Norman that night over chicken piquant. She was really pissed about that. </p><p> "It is an incredible story, Sandy." </p><p> "You think I know that?" </p><p> "How come we're having chicken tonight? It's Monday, we always have chicken on Wednesdays." </p><p> "I didn't stop to think. I just defrosted the first thing I saw when I opened the freezer. Besides, with the kids away, what's the difference?" </p><p> "The difference is that I count on chicken on Wednesdays, the way I count on pot roast on Thursdays and some sort of chopped meat on Tuesdays. I had chicken salad for lunch." </p><p> "Oh, I'm sorry." </p><p> "Did you get this recipe from your sister?" </p><p> "No, from <i>Elegant but Easy."</i> </p><p> "Not bad. You should have browned it first, though." </p><p> "It's a pain to brown chicken. That's why I made this one, you don't need to brown it first." </p><p> "It would look more appetizing if you did, next time." </p><p> "So close your eyes!" </p><p> "I'm just making a suggestion, San. No need to get so touchy about it," </p><p> "Who's touchy?" </p><p> Norman took off his glasses and wiped them with his dinner napkin. "I think what you need is new interests, especially now, with the kids away for the whole summer." </p><p> Was he doubting her story too? "I have plenty to do. There's the new house and besides that, I'm in going to read. I'm going to do the classics. I told you that." </p><p> "But you need to get out of the house more, to mingle," Norman said. </p><p> "I don't need to be around people all the time." </p><p> "You lack self-confidence." </p><p> "What's that supposed to mean?" </p><p> "I'm trying to tell you, trying to help you, if only you'll let me." </p><p> "Do you want more rice?" </p><p> "Yes, thank you. I think The Club is the answer, San." </p><p> "Oh, please, Norm, don't start that again." </p><p> "I thought we agreed that as soon as the kids left you'd give it another try." </p><p> "Look, I told you when you joined that it wasn't my thing...that I didn't want any part of it. So don't expect...don't ask me to..." She got up to clear away the dishes. </p><p> "Look at your sister," Norman said. </p><p> "You look at her." </p><p> "Four years older than you." </p><p> "Three and a half, but who's counting?" </p><p> "She loves The Club, practically lives there." </p><p> "She was always the family athlete." </p><p> "Tan and firm, in terrific shape." </p><p> "I failed gym in eighth grade, did you know that?" She put a plate of cookies on the table and set two cups of cold water, with tea bags, in the new microwave oven. </p><p> "You're not in the eighth grade any more, Sandy." He took a bite of one of the cookies. "Pepperidge Farm?" </p><p> "No, Keeblers." The microwave pinged and Sandy carried the teacups to the table. "Myra got straight A's in gym, all the way through school. She won letters. She was a goddamned cheerleader!" </p><p> "You ought to learn to do more with the microwave than just heat water." </p><p> "I don't like gadgets." </p><p> "Because you lack self-confidence." </p><p> "What does self-confidence have to do with the microwave?" </p><p> "What do gadgets have to do with it?" </p><p> "I tried The Club, Norm. I took two golf lessons and two tennis lessons and I was awful. I just don't have the aptitude, the coordination." </p><p> "Don't give me that shit, Sandy. You could be as good as most of the girls if you'd make the effort." He crunched another cookie. "Why don't you have your hair done...buy yourself something new to wear...you used to look terrific yourself." </p><p> "Jesus, you sound like my mother now." </p><p> "So she's noticed too?" </p><p> "I've been sick, Norm!" </p><p> "That was months ago. That's no excuse for now." </p><p> Sandy went to the sink and turned the water on full blast. </p><p> "I guess I'll walk Banushka," Norman said. </p><p> "You do that!" </p><p> "Oh, San, for God's sake." He tried to put his arms around her but she brushed him away. "You're so damned <i>touchy</i> these days," he said, "I can't even talk to you any more." </p><p> <i>Any more?</i> Sandy thought. But she didn't say it. </p><p> As soon as she heard the back door close she picked up a plate and flung it across the kitchen. It smashed into tiny pieces. She felt better. </p><p> Copyright � 1978 by Judy Blume</p></p><h2>100 Years of Bicycle Components and Accessory Design</h2><p><p>An extensive collection of drawings cf historic and more recent bicycle components collected by author Terashima.

Having been a muralist in the 1930s, by the 1940s Guston had turned away from public art to explore a more private vision. These haunting tableaux gave way in the 1950s to shimmering abstractions that represent one of the most poetic contributions to Abstract Expressionism. In the last and most important decade of his life, Guston's work changed yet again, as he invented bizarre, cartoonlike characters to enact monstrously comic fantasies. This abrupt shift from abstraction to figuration enraged the art establishment, but it also helped embolden a younger generation of artists to risk a new style of painting that became known as Neo-Expressionism.<br> <b>About the Modern Masters series:<br> </b>With informative, enjoyable texts and over 100 illustrations--approximately 48 in full color--this innovative series offers a fresh look at the most creative and influential artists of the postwar era. The authors are highly respected art historians and critics chosen for their ability to think clearly and write well.

Henry Wiencek explores the lives of black and white members of the Hairston clan, as they have accepted each other as one family, easing the historical divide between the races, and reveals how Southern families have been affected by slavery's legacy and by the burden it continues to carry. Visiting family reunions, interviewing family members, and exploring old plantations, Wiencek combs the far-reaching branches of the Hairston family tree to gather anecdotes from members about their ancestors and piece together a family history that involves the experiences of both plantation owners and their slaves. He expertly weaves the Hairstons' stories from all sides of historical events like slave emancipation, Reconstruction, school segregation, and lynching. For example, from a black Hairston, Wiencek learns of a slave who burned rail fences to cook a hog for his starving comrades; white Hairstons record the incident as an act of slave indolence, a way to hinder the next day's work.<p> As Wiencek tells the stories of individual Hairstons, he uncovers the layers of a shared history at times painful, shameful, extraordinary, and joyful. Beautifully describing the land of the South and faithfully recounting what he has been told, Wiencek testifies that he "heard history not as a historian would write it but as a novelist would imagine it." The dynamic stories in <i>The Hairstons</i> are not solely one family's legacy but a record that reflects America's complicated process of healing and understanding the mark of slavery. <i>--Amy Wan</i></p>"This is a moving and timely story of that which separates and binds black and white America. The Hairstons helps us understand our common past and present." JULIAN BOND "One would have to be hard-hearted indeed not to be moved by the big story this book tells...or by the little stories it tells of individual Hairstons whose lives reveal so much about what it is to be an American. It is scrupulous and honest in all respects, and a powerful testament to what this country, at its best, can be." JONATHN YARDLEY<p> "The Hairstons is an epic....Enthralling...Wiencek creates a profound under-standing of slavery, Jim Crow, and the civil rights movement. He uses documents, sometimes centuries old, to bring these Hairstons vividly to life."

Once a home design specialty that was little known, of limited interest, and a source of embarrassment more than pride, it is attracting widespread media attention and taking on (as befits its name) almost universal appeal -- and with good reason. The concept emerged years ago out of the need to make homes safe and accessible for the elderly, the handicapped and the very young. Some of the design options were good-looking, but others seemed institutional. Today, there are so many stylish, beautiful, good-sense universal-design options that choosing them has become a "why not?" rather than a "why?" decision. <p><b><i>Universal Design for the Home</i></b> features a blend of beautiful projects, creative ideas, and substantive planning information. Highly visual, the book features projects showing room contexts, as well as detail shots. The mix of projects encompasses small and large houses; one-story and multi-story houses; and ideas for general accessibility and comfort as well as some targeted more directly at handicap accessibility. There is an emphasis on remodeled projects, but new homes designed with an eye toward accessibility -- present and future -- are included as well. Chapters cover the spectrum of accessible home planning, from room arrangements to kitchens, baths, entries, and exterior areas. The book displays fresh, inspiring design ideas as well as must-have, good-sense solutions, such as wider doorways. Basic specifications, how-to tips, and other technical content are featured throughout the book in easy-to-find boxes and sidebars.</p></p><p>Wendy A.

He attended Marquette University, was graduated from the University of California at Santa Cruz, and received his Ph.D. from the State University of New York at Buffalo. Mr. Yep now lives in Pacific Grove, California.<p></p><p>One of children's literature's most respected Asian American authors, Mr. Yep has written many novels, including <i>Dragonwings,</i> a Newbery Honor Book of 1976, and <i>Dragon's Gate,</i> a Newbery Honor Book of 1994. He is also the author of <i>When the Circus Came to Town; The Imp That Ate My Homework,</i> winner of the Georgia Children's Book Award; and <i>The Magic Paintbrush.</i></p><p>The author of numerous other books for children and young adults, Mr. Yep has also taught creative writing and Asian American Studies at the University of California, Berkeley and Santa Barbara. In 1990 he received an NEA fellowship in fiction.</p>Grade 6-9-This novel, based on a true event, tells the story of two young teens who live in Rock Springs, WY, in 1885 when animosity between American and Chinese miners reaches its peak. Born in the U.S. of Chinese parents, Joseph Young considers himself an American, but both communities see him as only Chinese. Michael Purdy is an "outsider" because of his illegitimate birth. The boys meet when Michael escapes hounding by bullies and hides in a cave outside of town where Joseph is fossil hunting. In chapters that alternate between the two well-developed characters, the book describes their growing friendship despite the escalating trouble between the Chinese and the "Westerners" who blame the newcomers for their economic hardships and march on Chinatown in a rampage. Though the narrative leading up to the massacre and its aftermath is perhaps a bit too long, Yep does a good job portraying the rampant prejudice, and he does not sugarcoat the horrifying violence, told from Michael's point of view. In stark contrast to the inhumanity he sees in the streets, his mother acts humanely in spite of her negative view of the Chinese. This series entry adds another chapter to the tale of the Young family, who came to America from Kwangtung, China, and sheds needed light on a shameful, but forgotten, event in American history.<br><i>Barbara Scotto, Michael Driscoll School, Brookline, MA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>I, the Jury (Mike Hammer)</h2><p>In the first mystery featuring the tough private eye, Mike Hammer, he investigates the brutal murder of his best friend</p><p>Born Frank Morrison Spillane in Brooklyn, New York City, Mickey Spillane started writing while at high school. During the Second World War, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and became a fighter pilot and instructor. After the war, he moved to South Carolina. He was married three times, the third time to Jane Rogers Johnson, and had four children and two stepchildren. He wrote his first novel, I, the Jury (1947), in order to raise the money to buy a house for himself and his first wife, Mary Ann Pearce. The novel sold six and a half million copies in the United States, and introduced Spillane&#39;s most famous character, the hardboiled PI Mike Hammer. The many novels that followed became instant bestsellers, until in 1980 the US all-time fiction bestseller list of fifteen titles boasted seven by Mickey Spillane. More than 225 million copies of his books have sold internationally. He was uniformly disliked by critics, owing to the high content of sex and violence in his books. However, he was later praised by American mystery writers Max Alan Collins and William L. DeAndrea, as well as artist Markus Lupertz. The novelist Ayn Rand, a friend of Spillane&#39;s, appreciated the black-and-white morality of his books. Spillane was an active Jehovah&#39;s Witness.

Inside these books you will find requirements from the ranks of Yellow Belt through 4th Degree Black Belt. I began this project back around 1990 just after the passing of our beloved Senior Grand Master Edmund K. Parker. I made a call to Mrs. Leileni Parker (Ed Parkers&#39; wife and then President of the IKKA) to see if they would be continuing their Manuals of Kenpo. At that time, they had only had published the Green Belt Manual (later they Published the 3rd and 2nd Degree Brown Belt Manuals), but she informed me that would be it, because I already had earlier purchased 3 copies of the Accumulative Journal, as well as my personal training, I knew there was much more to offer. I expressed my desire to have more knowledge through the Manuals, and she said to me (Phone Conversation), &#34;We were going to do this but many instructors could not understand them, therefore we&#39;re not&#34; Well I felt slighted; I really enjoyed these Manuals because they reflected upon what I was teaching. Well it was then I began to put down all information on what I had to offer, this was through Research of many different Manuals, Ed Parkers&#39; many Books and Magazine articles, and the many Notes that I had taken in Seminars and Work-shops throughout the United States as well as from my Instructors.

A work of extraordinary imaginative invention, it might be described as "novelistic fantasy"&#x2013;&#x2013;a pioneering new direction in fiction which created its own protean form as it was written. Patchen mingled narrative with dream visions, surrealism with satire, poetry with statements of principle, and explored the then almost uncharted territory of visual word structures twenty years before "Concrete Poetry" became a popular international movement.<em>&nbsp;Sleepers Awake</em>&nbsp;is a rallying cry to young and old, as Patchen advances his long struggle against inhumanity, oppression, war and hypocrisy. Now brutal, now lyrical, he gives us life and the world as we must take them if they are to have full meaning, the horror and the beauty, the joy and the suffering together.</p><p><strong>Kenneth Patchen</strong> (1911-1972) was one of the most prolific American poets of his time. He was born in Niles, Ohio. He attended school at the University of Madison-Wisconsin where he met his wife, Miriam Oikemus. They moved to Greenwich Village and befriended many writers including E.E. Cummings, Anais Nin, and Henry Miller. An accident occurred after his first publication that would eventually leave him an invalid. He and his wife later moved to San Francisco during the early years of the Beat Movement. Many Beat poets would cite Patchen as a major influence. His "experimental protests" in poetry, painting, and prose remain unprecedented. Aside from his many books of poetry, his acclaimed novels, and his concrete visual works, Kenneth Patchen also collaborated with John Cage for the radio-play <em>The City Wears a Slouch Hat</em>, and worked with Charles Mingus developing jazz poetry. Patchen was an unwavering pacifist and many of his works have a political bent. Patchen was the first recipient of an NEA Literary Grant in 1967.&#x201c;To experience Patchen's work is to discover a peculiar sort of&nbsp;divinity.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Devendra Banhart</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In these fierce and hurrying years, Patchen's apocalyptic prophecies have come and are coming all too true.

At nine, cocky, aggressive Billy had already been expelled from school twice. Eight-year-old Jesse suffered from Tourette's syndrome. And then there was Venus.

Ugresic is a writer to follow. A writer to be cherished.&#34; Susan Sontag</p><p>An acclaimed novelist and essayist, Dubravka Ugresic is a native of the former Yugoslavia who left her homeland in 1993 for political reasons. She now lives in Amsterdam.In the bustling Anglo-American literary marketplace, the Eastern European exile doesn't stand a chance, says Ugresic (Have a Nice Day), herself in self-exile from Croatia. "The literary market demands that people adapt to the norms of production. As a rule, it does not tolerate disobedient artists, it does not tolerate experimenters, artistic subversives, performers of strange strategies in a literary text." Instead, it rewards the artistically obedient. Furthermore, Ugresic complains, literature has lost the exclusiveness it once had. Since the market determines what is good and what is bad based purely on what sells, the door has opened for every two-bit celebrity to hock their wares in mega-bookstores, leaving "real" writers out in the cold. The author compares herself to Eeyore, the famous grumbler, but the tone of this collection can be fickle-is the author playfully grumbling or bitterly mocking? In "GW, the Gloomy Writer" and "The Magnificent Buli," she mocks two types who have entered the global literary market: the male Eastern European writer with an inferiority complex and the genius/literary bulimic. In another piece, Ugresic playfully decries a marketplace that allows an empty personality like Ivana Trump to become a published author. At times, the analysis focuses so intently on the superficial business of marketing books that it overlooks the quiet intellectual activity that energizes English departments all across the United States, those little enclaves where Ivana Trump's output makes nary a ripple. And since an academic audience frustrated with the commodification of books is the primary target for these essays, that feels like a significant omission. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Crown of Renewal (Legend of Paksenarrion)</h2><p><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY&nbsp;<i>KIRKUS REVIEWS<br></i></b><br>Acclaimed author Elizabeth Moon spins gripping, richly imagined epic fantasy novels that have earned comparisons to the work of such authors as Robin Hobb and Lois McMaster Bujold.

On the morning before the nightlong vigil, Meddthal Andressat, the Count of Andressat&#x2019;s second son and present commander in the north, woke to hear the thud of the inner door closing, then voices in the tower&#x2019;s main hall: exclamations, then quieter tones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Someone, he gathered, had sent something to someone as a gift. Found it by the door. Sighing, he pushed back the covers, dressed quickly, and went out to see what was going on. Families did not normally come to the towers to leave gifts for their kin on duty, especially not during winter storms. Especially not without pounding on the door and coming inside. He thought immediately of treachery, poisoned food, perhaps, sent by an enemy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever it is, don&#x2019;t eat it,&#x201d; he said, coming into the mess, then stopped short as he saw the wide eyes and horrified expressions turned toward him and the quick movement of men hiding something from their commander. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; he demanded. &#x201c;Show me.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The sergeant who had served with him since Meddthal first gained command shook his head. &#x201c;Sir, you don&#x2019;t want to see this.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I do. Stand aside.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Sir, please. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;. . . it&#x2019;s horrible&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meddthal could feel the hairs on his arms rising; cold foreboding struck like a blow. His younger brother Filis had been missing since the previous summer, disappearing on a routine trip from Andressat to Cortes Cilwan. Almost certainly Filis had been captured by the one man in Aarenis who would want an Andressat son in his hands: Alured the Black, self--styled Duke of Immer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Filis,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a letter, sir. To Count Andressat.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meddthal moved forward. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s more than that by the way you&#x2019;re all acting. Stand aside. I must see to report to my father.&#x201d; He braced himself for horrors: Filis&#x2019;s head, Filis&#x2019;s body. Then he saw it, and his breath came short, his vision darkened.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The box had been made with great skill, leather laid over a framework of wood. Filis&#x2019;s face formed the top&#x2014;-skillfully padded enough to show the contours, like a mask, though much flattened, the ears&#x2014;-those distinctive ears&#x2014;-forming a hideously decorative border to left and right. Meddthal struggled to think about that, not that it was <i>Filis&#x2019;s</i> face, the familiar face of a brother he had loved and quarreled with. Not&#x2014;-absolutely <i>not</i>&#x2014;-about how it had been taken from Filis, whether Filis had been skinned before or after death.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He struggled to stay upright, to breathe, to hold back the nausea that threatened to shame him in front of all. He became aware gradually that the sergeant&#x2019;s arm was around him, steadying him&#x2014;-a strong, warm arm, and most of all a <i>live</i> arm. That his men were looking away from him, giving him time to recover, stirring about as if it were a normal morning and they were getting ready for another day. He dragged in one lungful after another of the chill air&#x2014;-air that would never be warm after this. And looked again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He could not unsee what he had seen. He could not unthink the thoughts that raced through his mind, deadly as a flight of arrows. He had known&#x2014;-they had all known&#x2014;-that Filis was likely dead, killed by Alured or at his command. They had told themselves that; they had even&#x2014;-as his father had said aloud first&#x2014;-hoped he was dead and past suffering. Had it been Filis&#x2019;s severed head&nbsp;. . . even a body bearing marks of torture&nbsp;. . . it would not have been so bad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Filis&#x2019;s hair fell over the back of the box, carefully braided with ribbons in Immer&#x2019;s colors and formed into a decorative knot. On one corner was a scar Meddthal recognized from Filis&#x2019;s shoulder&nbsp;. . . then he saw the fine stitching that had attached that piece of Filis&#x2019;s skin to the others. A tube&#x2014;-it must be the message tube with the letter to Count Andressat&#x2014;-protruded obscenely from Filis&#x2019;s mouth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rage shook him as suddenly as horror had. That scum had planned all this to the last detail&nbsp;. . . to foul one of the year&#x2019;s holiest days, Sunreturn, with such horror&nbsp;. . . to make of it not the day of hope and joy Midwinter Feast had always been but to stain it with the memory of Filis&#x2019;s death.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It was in a sack, tied with a green ribbon,&#x201d; one of the men said. &#x201c;There was a message: Send it to Count Andressat as a Midwinter gift from his liege, it said.&#x201d; He pointed to the sack, crumpled on the floor, coarsely woven, and the ribbon with a wooden tag still attached.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meddthal shook his head. &#x201c;He has no liege, and it would kill him.&#x201d; To his surprise, his voice sounded almost normal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re never going to hide it from him&#x2014;-&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;m not going to hide it. But he will have word from me, to blunt the blade, before I send it. Now, however, I will open Immer&#x2019;s letter. Simthal, is the food ready?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;For Midwinter, sir? I thought&#x2014;-&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;We have much to do, and days are short. We will eat, and we will prepare for the attack that is surely coming.&#x201d; Already his mind was working again, offering alternatives and the problems with each. In Midwinter, no one could ride from this tower to Cortes Andres in one day&#x2019;s light&nbsp;. . . but had Alured&#x2019;s men sent a message directly to the Count? No&nbsp;. . . they wanted to unnerve the border guards first. &#x201c;Tell the cooks: breakfast now. And we will observe most parts of the Midwinter ceremony, though we will not be fools and exhaust ourselves in games this day. We will honor Filis&#x2019;s memory best by saving Andressat from the same fate.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They nodded. Someone handed him a mug of sib, and he sipped cautiously&nbsp;. . . his stomach kept it down. The tears burning his eyes did not overflow. He took the tube from between the lips, leaving a gaping hole in the face, and untied the green and black ribbons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was written in blood; the rusty color could be nothing else. &#x201c;Brother,&#x201d; he murmured, and kissed it. Filis had died, no doubt a terrible death, but this was proof he was no traitor, as some had thought. The words made it clear what had been done and when and how. A terrible death indeed. The box had not required all of Filis&#x2019;s skin&nbsp;. . . the rest had been made into a rug for Alured&#x2019;s bedside&#x2014;-&#x201c;and as I stand on it each day, so will I stand on Andressat: master of all.&#x201d; &#x201c;The best parts&#x201d; of Filis&#x2019;s broken body had been cooked and force--fed to the Count of Cilwan and his wife before they were killed and their bodies fed to dogs, their skins added to the rug.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So Alured had killed not only Filis but their sister, and his father had lost two children. Thank the gods their child, the count&#x2019;s grandson, was safe in Cortes Andres. A few tears slipped from Meddthal&#x2019;s eyes. Nerinth had been married to Cilwan young, unwillingly and had endured years with that&#x2014;-Meddthal cut off the thought. It would do no good now to despise Cilwan&#x2019;s timidity and avarice. He blinked back more tears and read on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The rest was yet more boasts and threats. Meddthal thought of burning it, saving his father that knowledge, but the old man would not thank him. He rolled the letter once more and put it back in the tube, then put the tube into his belt pouch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cooks had brought in bread, porridge, pastries, roasts; for a moment his stomach turned again. But vengeance required nourishment. Starving himself, heaving his food out: neither one would help him defeat Alured. He forced down a bowl of porridge and a slab of bacon. Others ate after seeing him eat. He went to the door and opened it, shut it behind him, then opened the outer door. A gray day, just enough light to see, barely past dawn. Low clouds like a lid shut them away from the sun. Wind cut through his clothes like a knife. He went back into the vestibule when the wind had frozen the tears on his face, and brushed the tiny ice chips away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kolfin was his best rider, and his own horse the fastest. Meddthal wanted to go himself, but if Alured did plan to attack&#x2014;-and he himself would have&#x2014;-in the next few days, he needed to be here to command the defense. He went back inside. &#x201c;Kolfin.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kolfin stood up from the table. &#x201c;Sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Finish quickly. Take two days&#x2019; ration, and you&#x2019;ll ride my horse to Cortes Andres with my letter. Be ready to ride when I&#x2019;ve written it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He sat down with pen and ink, and his mind blanked again. Filis. This&nbsp;. . . this abomination&nbsp;. . . but his father must know something, and as soon as possible. He wrote quickly, plainly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Father. Bad news. Filis&#x2019;s death proved; Alured has sent&#x2014;-</i></p><p></p><p>He paused. He could not say it all, not like this&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x2014;-proof of what he did to Filis. It is beyond my words to say. Laid on our doorstep here last night; no doubt it is Filis. I expect attack when he thinks we are unmanned by grief; I remain here to command defense but will come at your command, bringing what was sent. I send also the letter he wrote you, written in what I am sure is Filis&#x2019;s blood, admitting he killed the Count of Cilwan and your daughter as well.</i></p><p></p><p>He sealed that, put it and the letter from Alured in a message bag, and gave it to Kolfin, who had already saddled Meddthal&#x2019;s horse. &#x201c;Take a spare horse,&#x201d; Meddthal said. &#x201c;Ride fast but warily. Those who did this may be looking to intercept any messenger.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; Kolfin took the message bag; another soldier brought out another of the horses, saddled it, and transferred Kolfin&#x2019;s saddlebags to the second horse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Kolfin had ridden away, Meddthal set about readying for attack. By midday, he had completed that chore as well as sending couriers to the two nearest towers to warn them. &#x201c;Half of you must rest this afternoon,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If they attack, it will be when they think we have all spent a sleepless night in the dark after a day of grief and worry or perhaps drunken rage. Tomorrow&#x2014;-or even the day after&#x2014;-is when they will come.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What about tonight, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Tonight we will do as we always do. Today and tomorrow, however, we will rest as much as we can, to be fresh when they attack.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And&nbsp;. . . that? Him?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meddthal looked at the table, at Filis&#x2019;s face staring upward from the top of the box. It felt&#x2014;-it was&#x2014;-indecent to leave it there like any other box. But he could not close it into the storeroom&nbsp;. . . or put it outside&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the youngest men, Dannrith, spoke up. &#x201c;Sir, someone dyin&#x2019; or dead should have a candle and someone by. They wouldn&#x2019;t of give him a candle&nbsp;. . . We should.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A scrape of boots on the floor as others considered that, and a low murmur, then they all looked at Meddthal. The silence lengthened as Meddthal tried to think, in a mind suddenly fuzzy, whether to say yes or no, where to put the thing, in here or in his quarters or&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stay with &#x2019;im,&#x201d; said another. And then a chorus of offers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That settled it. &#x201c;In here, then,&#x201d; Meddthal said. &#x201c;Bring a trestle and a blanket. We&#x2019;ll do this right.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Very shortly the grisly box had been placed at one end of a plank, with a blanket laid flat below it and Meddthal&#x2019;s best cloak spread over it, hiding the face and making, with the blanket, a pretense of a body laid straight for burial. Though it was not yet sundown, they lit a candle, and one at a time, as if for a new death, each spoke a word about Filis, for all had at least seen him, if they had not known him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then Meddthal sent half of them to bed, to be wakened at full dark, and the rest took up their duties except for the watcher. At each turn of the glass another took his place. At full dark, when all assembled, the hearth had been swept clean and a new fire laid but not lit. Only the feeble glow of one candle outlined the shape on the board and the face of the one who sat beside him. The others turned their faces from the light and began the long night&#x2019;s watch for Sun-return.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When it was Meddthal&#x2019;s turn to sit beside his brother&#x2019;s remains, he wondered if his father would send for him or for the box alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>uy</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>J</p><p>eddrin, Count of Andressat, looked at the face of his dead son and wept. Rage burned in his heart, but grief drowned it for the moment, and he made no attempt to hold back the tears. Let them fall; let them flow; let them be emptied like a bronze bowl so the flame of vengeance could burn higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the tears ended, he looked more closely. Honoring the dead, especially those who died in war, required the mourners to see and respect every mark life had made on them. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll give him his rightful colors,&#x201d; he said, and began unwinding the complex knot that the braided hair had been coiled into. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll not go under earth wearing that scum&#x2019;s.&#x201d; After the knot came the braids themselves. Three braids; his sons Narits and Tamir, Narits recalled from Cha earlier in the year and Tamir recalled from the south ward, each took one, and he took the last.

Although appropriate for parents and caregivers, the conversations and activities are meant for children to read alone or with a parent. Full of practical tips and a specific program for overcoming this embarrassing condition, this guide covers topics such as waking-up practice, bedwetting alarms, and how to handle sleepovers. Cartoon characters Bladder Man (a superhero) and Nephron put a humorous spin on the subject and help explain the causes of bedwetting, and numerous examples of others that share the condition show children that they are not the only ones who are affected. Simple activities keep children engaged and help them grasp how their urinary system functions, while Q&amp;A sections provide more detailed information for parents.<br></p><p><b>Howard J.

She acknowledges and celebrates the odd mystery and mysticism of the act&#x2015;the fact that poetry must both guard and reveal, hint at and pull back.... Also, and maybe most crucially, Ruefle&#x2019;s work is never once stuffy or overdone: she writes this stuff with a level of seriousness-as-play that&#x2019;s vital and welcome, that doesn&#x2019;t make writing poetry sound anything but wild, strange, life-enlargening fun.&#x201d; <br><br><b>&#x2015;<i>Kenyon Review</i></b><br>&#x201c;Ruefle has shown a talent for elevating her acute observations and narrative inclination well above mere anecdote to create quietly disquieting moments&#x2015;a literature of barbed ambiguity and unresolved disruption.&#x201d; <br><br><b>&#x2015;<i>Bookforum</i></b><br>&#x201c;Ruefle is the Poet Laureate of the City of Ideas &#x2015; surreal and lyrical and deeply moving at the same time.&#x201d; <br><br><b>&#x2015;<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b><br>&#x201c;Ruefle&#x2019;s speakers muse in a very deliberate, declarative syntax in a lot of universalities, generalities, and absolutes, speaking often for all of us.&#x201d; <br><br><b>&#x2015;<i>Ploughshares</i></b><br>&#x201c;As a verbal hunter-gatherer, Ruefle is a barometer of our lyric listening.

One of the main themes is that social theory must recognize, as it has not done hitherto, that all social actors are knowledgeable about the social systems they produce and reproduce in their conduct. In order to grasp the significance of this, he argues, we have to reconsider some of the most basic concepts in sociology.<br><br>In particular, Giddens argues, it is essential to recognize the significance of time-space relations in social theory. He rejects the distinction between synchrony and diachrony, or statics and dynamics, involved in both structuralism and functionalism, and offers extensive critical commentary on the latter as an approach to sociology.<br><br>The book, which can be described as a "non-functionalist manifesto," breaks with the three main theoretical traditions in the social sciences today while retaining the significant contributions each contains. In so doing Giddens discusses a range of fundamental problem areas in the social sciences: power and domination, conflict and contradiction, and social transformation. He concludes with an overall appraisal of the key problems in social theory today.</p><p>"One of the most creative among the younger generation of critical social theorists, Giddens stands alone in his concern for the classical tradition on sociology; but he also makes brilliant use of the latest philosophical and theoretical work of several contemporary schools and disciplines. A very important book for all of social science."&#x2015;Jeffrey C.

The garden was transformed from a plaything for the rich to a democratic exercise: a hobby for the millions. Few figures were more central to and prominent in this transition than eccentric Reginald Farrer, whose passion for alpines would put a rockery in the backyards of countless enthusiasts and whose adventures in Tibet and China collecting elusive and exotic specimens: the wild tree peony, a new buddleaia, and even an entire new genus called Farreria, were the stuff of legends. But Farrer was a strange man, a tortured soul. Tormented by physical disabilities (he had a hare lip, a "pygmy body," and a cleft palate) he developed a personality to match: defensive, restless, yet productive and endlessly energetic.<br><br>Although "born to endless night," within his realm of horticultural exploration and exploitation, he was a giant, parlaying his disadvantages into advantages, becoming one of the great plant hunters of his age, repeatedly travelling to Japan and Tibet to collect new species and, through the influence of his extraordinary series of books, changing forever the art and practice of Western gardening.</p><p>Nicola Shulman is a writer and reviewer for publications including the Sunday Telegraph, the TLS and Harpers &amp; Queen. She lives with her family in London and in Yorkshire. Her latest book, Graven with Diamonds, the Many Lives of Thomas Wyatt: Courtier, Poet, Assassin, Spy was published by Short Books this year.When it was published in the U.K. in 2002, this slim volume earned considerable praise from both garden writers and literary critics. That's fitting, because while Farrer (1880&#x2013; 1920) virtually invented rock gardening as it is now practiced and revolutionized garden writing, his ambition was to be a "literary figure." His novels ranged from "entirely mortal" (<i>The House of Shadows</i>) to "dreadful" (<i>Through the Ivory Gate</i>), but represented what he thought of as his higher calling. Journalist Schulman's biography puts Farrer's highly successful horticultural activities in the context of his frustrated grander aspirations. It is a balanced portrait of a brilliant but "touchy, reproachful, extremely demanding, painfully solipsistic" man, told succinctly and tastefully. Farrer's relationship with his rigidly Christian parents was poor and became abysmal when he converted to Buddhism. Letters to his Oxford classmate Aubrey Herbert strongly suggest a homosexual orientation. Schulman presents this information simply and directly; it's relevant but not central to the story. What is central is Farrer's talent for observing, growing, describing, cataloguing and discovering alpine plants. He literally traveled to the ends of the earth to find new ones, braving hardship and danger on expeditions to China, Tibet and, finally, Burma, where he died. With this brief work, Schulman reveals a brilliant, charming and idiosyncratic character. Illus. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Presenting Israel&#39;s national history from a divine viewpoint, these narratives measure the kings of Israel and Judah not by the mark they leave on secular history, but by their &#34;doing what is right in the Lord&#39;s sight.&#34; Embedded in this story are enduring lessons of the ways of God with his people in every age.In this commentary Donald Wiseman brings to this portion of Scripture his life-long study of the archeology, history, languages and documents of the ancient Near East.

The first part of the book deals with dream analysis in its practical application, the problems and aims of modern psychotherapy, and also his own theory of psychological types. The middle section addresses Jung's beliefs about the stages of life and Archaic man. He also contrasts his own theories with those of Sigmund Freud.&nbsp; In the latter parts of the book Jung discusses psychology and literature and devotes a chapter to the basic postulates of analytical psychology. The last two chapters are devoted to the spiritual problem of modern man in aftermath of World War I. &nbsp;He compares it to the flowering of gnosticism in the 2nd century and investigates how psychotherapists are like the clergy.</p></p><p>No Bio&#39;He was more than a psychological or scientific phenomenon; he was to my mind one of the greatest religious phenomena the world has ever experienced.&#39; - Laurens van der Post &#39;His psychological approach is deeply interesting and should stimulate many who are today more ready to trust a doctor than a clergyman, to help them to rediscover the meaning of life.&#39; - The Guardian &#39;Jung was the first to see that, of all the crises facing humanity, the lack of any sense of meaning in life is the crisis that guarantees all the rest. Whether the reader self-defines as modern, late modern of post-modern, the predicament that Jung lays out in bleak detail still strikes a chord. His suggestion that any possible solutions - political ecological, philosophical or religious - must include and respect elements of what lies deep within the psyche (&#39;the soul&#39;) continues to challenge and to inspire.&#39; - Andrew Samuels, Professor of Analytical Psychology, University of Essex &#39;This slim volume contains the quintessence of Jung&#39;s thinking. Originally published in 1933, it was the first readily accessible presentation in English of the great psychologist&#39;s basic ideas about psychotherapy, dream interpretation, psychological types, the stages of life and his differences with Sigmund Freud. His observations on the relationship between the &#34;archaic man&#34; and &#34;modern man&#34; anticipate those of contemporary evolutionary psychiatry, while his diagnosis of what alls western culture has been endorsed by subsequent history. An invaluable book for those seeking an introduction to Jungian psychology, expressed - with unusual clarity - in the master&#39;s own words.&#39; - Anthony Stevens</p><h2>House of Secrets</h2><p>Offers a disturbing look at the life of Eddie Lee Sexton, who convinced his daughter to suffocate her infant, had his son kill the baby&#39;s father, and committed other heinous crimes, such as physical and sexual abuse, extortion, incest, and more, and examines his wife&#39;s role in the insanity, violence, and evil. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>"Eddie Lee Sexton is evil incarnate. Like Charles Manson, he exercised a cult-like mind control over others who did his dirty work. But unlike Manson, both Sexton's victims and his subjects were his very own flesh and blood." As strong as they are, these words from an assistant district attorney barely hint at the depravity hidden for years within the Sexton family. Strange notions about "Futuretrons" and hand markings that convey absolute power, revelations of incest and physical abuse, bodies buried in the camping area of a Florida state park--<i> House of Secrets</i> has so many layers of weirdness that it will amaze even seasoned readers of true crime. Lowell Cauffiel has a talent for combining quotations from interviews and unembellished facts into prose that reads like a novel. Two people are dead, and the children who suffered the cruel fate of being born into the Sexton family may never completely heal from their injuries--but at least their story has been told.<b>Lowell Cauffiel&nbsp;</b>is an American true crime author, novelist, and TV producer. A native of Michigan, he was an award-winning reporter with the&nbsp;<i>Detroit News</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Detroit Monthly Magazine</i>&nbsp;during the 1970s and 1980s.

In <i>A Muse and a Maze</i>, Turchi draws out the similarities between writing and puzzle-making and its flip-side, puzzle-solving. As he teases out how mystery lies at the heart of all storytelling, he uncovers the magic the creation of credible illusion that writers share with the likes of Houdini and master magicians. In Turchi&#x2019;s associative narrative, we learn about the history of puzzles, their obsessive quality, and that Benjamin Franklin was a devotee of an ancient precursor of sudoku called Magic Squares. Applying this rich backdrop to the requirements of writing, Turchi reveals as much about the human psyche as he does about the literary imagination and the creative process.</p><p><b>Peter Turchi's</b> books include <i>Maps of the Imagination: The Writer as Cartographer</i>; <i>Suburban Journals: The Sketchbooks, Drawings, and Prints of Charles Ritchie</i>, in collaboration with the artist; a novel, <i>The Girls Next Door</i>; and a collection of stories, <i>Magician</i>. Turchi's short story "Night, Truck, Two Lights Burning," listed as one of 100 Notable Stories of 2002 by the editors of Best American Short Stories and one of 15 Recommended Stories by the jury for the O. Henry Prize Stories, has been published in Arabic and, in English, combined with images by Charles Ritchie, in a limited edition artist's book. He has also coedited, with Andrea Barrett, <i>A Kite in the Wind: Fiction Writers on Their Craft</i> and <i>The Story Behind the Story: 26 Stories by Contemporary Writers and How They Work</i>; and, with Charles Baxter, <i>Bringing the Devil to His Knees: The Craft of Fiction and the Writing Life</i>. Turchi's stories have appeared in <i>Ploughshares, Story, the Alaska Quarterly Review, Puerto del Sol</i>, and the <i>Colorado Review</i>. He has received Washington College's Sophie Kerr Prize, an Illinois Arts Council Literary Award, North Carolina's Sir Walter Raleigh Award, and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. From 1993 to 2008 he directed the MFA Program for Writers at Warren Wilson College in Asheville, North Carolina. Turchi recently taught at Arizona State University, where he was director of the creative writing program, and he's currently a professor of creative writing at the University of Houston.THE CONTEMPLATION OF RECURRING PATTERNS [introduction]<br><br> Endlessly retyped, [the novel looked] at every stage like a jigsaw puzzle as they labored . . . bits and pieces of it taped to every available surface in Gottlieb&#x2019;s cramped office. That, I thought, is editing.&#x201d;<br> Michael Korda, on editor Robert Gottlieb&#x2019;s work with Joseph Heller on Catch-22<br><br>Every piece of writing is a kind of puzzle. This is true not only of a complex satirical novel but of a Shakespearean sonnet, an autobiographical essay, a play or screenplay, a love letter, and an email to a colleague about a problem at work. Whom do we address? With what tone? How should we begin? What do we want the reader to think or feel or understand? Is it best to be direct or indirect, sincere or disarming? Should we start with a joke? A quotation?<br><br>There are many different kinds of puzzles, but generally speaking, a puzzle is an array of material or information that requires a solution. Let&#x2019;s say a woman has a job, she works hard, but at the end of the month she doesn&#x2019;t have enough money to pay her bills. Circumstances have presented her with a puzzle, a problem to solve. She could take on a second job, or stop eating out, or rob a convenience store all possible solutions but instead she decides to write a letter to her employer asking for a raise. The composition of that letter is another puzzle. Should it be a demand or a request? How should she support her argument? Should she mention that she&#x2019;s paying her mother&#x2019;s medical bills? It&#x2019;s a large company, very professional, so she decides she should simply state the circumstances, offering a few highlights of her excellent work and its benefits to the company. She deliberates over whether to issue an ultimatum ( More money, or off I go&#x201d;) or to acknowledge her employer&#x2019;s perspective ( These are difficult times, so if the budget won&#x2019;t allow it now, maybe next year?&#x201d;). She decides not to mention that she knows two less-experienced men in her office are being paid higher salaries not yet, anyway. Has she chosen well, arranged all the pieces successfully? She&#x2019;ll know as soon as she gets her response.<br><br>A short story or novel is a different kind of puzzle; and it is more than a puzzle.<br><br>The composition of a story is a puzzle for the writer, whose job is to decide what to include, what to exclude, and how to organize the parts. The problem is compounded by the fact that, as fiction writers, we begin to write without knowing precisely what we&#x2019;re trying to create. The work continually changes form, and emphasis, and purpose. Characters disappear, new characters are added; some scenes grow longer, others are reduced to summary. A pocket watch that just happened to be in a dresser drawer suddenly seems to indicate something larger. We can&#x2019;t truly solve the puzzle, or arrange the words and sentences and characters and events most effectively, until we finally feel confident that we understand what we&#x2019;re trying to create.<br><br>But while composing a piece of fiction is like assembling a puzzle, the finished work is not presented by the writer as a puzzle for the reader to solve. There may be puzzles within the story, elements of plot or character or imagery or meaning that require the reader&#x2019;s active participation, but the story as a whole is not a problem with a solution. Like Ariadne&#x2019;s thread allowing Theseus to journey into and safely out of the mythical labyrinth, a story means to lead the reader somewhere. But the destination isn&#x2019;t a monster, or a pot of gold, or a bit of wisdom. Instead, the destination is something or several things to contemplate. The best stories and novels lead the reader not to an explanation, but to a place of wonder. How do we know that? Because the books and stories and poems that mean the most to us are the ones we want to read again, to reexperience and reconsider.<br><br>****<br><br> Magic is an art very closely related to poetry. The poet manipulates words, and the magician manipulates objects. We are transcending reality in order to produce something poetic, something beautiful, something interior.&#x201d;<br> Spanish magician Juan Tamariz<br><br>The word magic&#x201d; is commonly used to refer both to a ritualized performance with a long history (the ancient Greeks wrote about magi, or magicians) and, more vaguely, to something transcendent that the speaker either can&#x2019;t or would rather not explain ( That night in Venice was magic, just plain magic&#x201d;). The history of magic is richly populated with scientists and mathematicians, inventors and entertainers, gamblers, thieves, and con men. Professional magicians tend not to refer to what they do as tricks,&#x201d; since that implies gimmickry a trap door, a hollow pencil, a coin with a hole drilled through its center. The preferred term is illusion,&#x201d; which can apply to effects facilitated by a mechanical device (a trap door, a hollow pencil, a drilled coin) as well as to those facilitated by skill and practice (a playing card palmed on the back of the hand, a deck cut to the exact same card ten times out of ten), and to those facilitated by surprising scientific and mathematical principles. Many card tricks are based on simple but non-obvious math.<br><br>A magical illusion is a puzzle for the magician who, like that woman hoping for a raise, imagines an intended effect (a rabbit produced from a hat that appeared to be empty) and then organizes his materials, movements, words, and gestures to create that effect for an audience. In theory, the illusion is a puzzle for the audience, too (Where did that rabbit come from?). But the sort of person inclined to watch a magic show is the sort of person who, while understanding that there must be a perfectly mundane explanation for how the illusion was created, simultaneously hopes to be moved to a state of wonder in the same way that a reader who picks up a new novel hopes to be transported by mere ink on paper, the arrangement of words on a page.<br><br>The composer of a puzzle means to present a challenge, but also intends for his audience to solve it. A magician presents an illusion with the understanding that, while it can be solved,&#x201d; or explained, his purpose is to disguise that solution so we can experience something that, however briefly, transcends rational understanding. It&#x2019;s tempting to say that a writer, then, is a kind of magician. A writer gives us a story not to provoke us to admire how it was produced, or to challenge us to tease out some hidden or coded message, but to invite us to think about something he or she has found worthy of extended consideration. But unlike a magical illusion, some of the most powerful effects of a story, poem, or novel, actually do transcend rational explanation. Discussions of the writer&#x2019;s craft, of conscious decisions, can take us only so far. There&#x2019;s mystery in it for the writer as well as for readers.<br><br>*****<br><br> Puzzles are not solved by the use of accurate reckoning alone . . . but also by a substantial use of insight thinking [an admixture of imagination and memory]. Insight thinking does not emerge fortuitously or haphazardly. It comes about only after the observation and contemplation of recurring patterns.&#x201d;<br> Marcel Danesi<br><br>The writer&#x2019;s craft is what we can study; and by looking carefully at the work that speaks most strongly to us we can, gradually, discern patterns, choices, and decisions we find effective.<br><br>Our curiosity, our interest in problems, means that many of us get pleasure from writing that yields more each time we read or see or hear it. Happily, there are plenty of stories and novels that offer up both immediate pleasure and the rewards that come from prolonged meditation. The challenge for writers is to arrange information words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, scenes, images in ways that are intriguing, arresting, curiosity-arousing, and illuminating. In any particular story, novel, or poem (or essay, play, or screenplay), we need to regard how we&#x2019;re arranging that information, for whom, and why.<br><br>That&#x2019;s what this book is about.<br><br>This book is not so much a sequel but a companion to Maps of the Imagination: The Writer as Cartographer. Both books are, at least in part, about ways in which a piece of writing is designed. They both mean to invite writers to think differently about what we do. (That first-person plural pronoun is generally used to refer to writers, but also at times to readers, under the assumption that all writers read.) While the two books overlap in places, and some of the same authors are mentioned, I&#x2019;ve tried to avoid unnecessary repetition. In Maps of the Imagination, it seemed useful to focus on the extended metaphor and to offer brief illustrations from a wide variety of writers. The topics contemplated here seemed better investigated by more detailed discussions. In several places I refer to visual artist Charles Ritchie, whose work and process served as initial inspiration. While the primary focus is on fiction, much of what is here could apply to any form of writing.<br><br>The chapters that follow consider the tension between puzzle and mystery; the gaps and contradictions that make fictional characters nearly as complex as actual people; the writer as a magician, directing the audience&#x2019;s attention away from himself and toward a created representative; the maze we find ourselves in when we try to follow the narrative line&#x201d;; and our desire, as readers and as writers, for challenge, as perverse as that sometimes seems. Appearing along the way are Jerry Seinfeld, Harry Houdini, Bruce Springsteen, The Wizard of Oz, Wassily Kandinsky, tangrams, famous Norwegians, reindeer hunters, and a disappearing elephant. You&#x2019;ll also encounter a variety of puzzles, which can be ignored or solved; the solutions appear in the notes to each chapter. If you&#x2019;d like to try your hand at the tangrams, you can cut out the pieces on the last page of the book.<br><br>Art is often discussed as a form of play but that playfulness, that sense of delight, is frequently absent from discussions of the writing process, and of what we tend to call the work.&#x201d; But even T. S. You must go by a way wherein there is no ecstasy&#x201d; Eliot was a fan of the Marx Brothers. No matter how serious the tone, literature offers pleasure in its construction as well as in its content, and in the ways it connects us to others. While it&#x2019;s possible to forget, as we push ourselves to revise and improve, we write because it gives us at least occasionally delight. This book, then, is offered as a provocation, a companion, and a reminder of the joy writing offers.</p><h2>Final Fantasy Origins: Official Strategy Guide</h2><p><p> </p><p><b> Conquer Two Classic RPGs, with One BradyGames Strategy Guide! </b></p> <ul> <li> BradyGames� <i>FINAL FANTASY ORIGINS Official Strategy Guide</i> provides complete walkthroughs for both <i>FINAL FANTASY�</i> and <i>FINAL FANTASY� II</i>. </li> <li> Unstoppable boss strategy. </li> <li> All-inclusive bestiary, area maps, and detailed item and weapon lists. </li> <li> Game secrets and all side quests and mini-games revealed! </li> </ul></p><p><p>BradyGames' FINAL FANTASY ORIGINS Official Strategy Guide features complete coverage of this inspiring collection of FINAL FANTASY and FINAL FANTASY II.

Reprint.</p><p>Here are more than 200 delicious seasonal recipes from the upper Midwest -- from the lakes, the forest, and farmlands, as well as from the small towns and cities of Minnesota, Wisconsin in, Iowa, Michigan, and North Dakota. <br>The wonderful variety of dishes tells the story of the Scandinavian, German, East European, Scottish, and Welsh farmers who first settled here, cultivating the rich farmlands and developing the milling industry and the dairy cooperatives. At threshing time, barn raisings, and hog killings, robust dishes satisfied the appetite, and miners and loggers (from Finland to Slovenia) relished the hearty foods of boardinghouses and cook shacks. <br>Beth Dooley and Lucia Watson have brought together all the strands of this colorful Northern Heartland history by giving us the foods that tell the story. They have tempered the recipes for today's appetites and developed new creations that make the most of the indigenous produce -- the kinds of fresh and flavorful dishes that devotees of Lucia's popular restaurant in Minneapolis have been enjoying since it first opened in 1985. <br>Here is a sampling: <br>-- From their Milling and Baking chapter -- Finnish Cardamom Coffee Bread, Lussekatter Buns, Swedish Limpa Rye, German Oven Pancake<br>-- From The Communal Pot -- Roasted Vegetable Strudel, Thresher's Beef Stew, Sarma (Stuffed Cabbage Rolls), and Pasties (a delectable version of what is known as "the boardinghouse meal under a crust")<br>-- From North Woods and Prairies -- Holiday Roast Wild Turkey, Grouse with Cranberry-Sage Butter, Woodcock with Wild Mushrooms<br>-- From Deep Lakes and Swift Streams -- Baked Walleye with Asparagus and Fiddlehead Ferns, Pan-Fried Trout withSmoky Bacon and Hazelnuts, Spring Crappies with Morels<br>-- From Backyard Gardens and Sacred Paddies -- Summer Tomato, Potato, and Eggplant Bake, winter Gratin of Pumpkin and Leeks, Wild Rice Pilaf with Dried Cherries and Walnuts <br>In this part of America where people are separated by long distances, hospitality means good food.

The addition of twelve penguins to the family made it impossible to make both ends meet. Then Mr. Popper had a splendid idea &#x2014; the talented penguins would be a sensation on the stage. And so they were...</p><p>More than 60 years have not dated this wonderfully absurd tale--it still makes kids (and parents) laugh out loud. Poor Mr. Popper isn't exactly unhappy; he just wishes he had seen something of the world before meeting Mrs. Popper and settling down. Most of all, he wishes he had seen the Poles, and spends his spare time between house-painting jobs reading all about polar explorations. Admiral Drake, in response to Mr. Popper's fan letter, sends him a penguin; life at 432 Proudfoot Avenue is never the same again. From one penguin living in the icebox, the Popper family grows to include 12 penguins, all of whom must be fed. Thus is born "Popper's Performing Penguins, First Time on Any Stage, Direct from the South Pole." Their adventures while on tour are hilarious, with numerous slapstick moments as the penguins disrupt other acts and invade hotels. Classic chapter-a-night fun. (Ages 5 to 10) <i>--Richard Farr</i>Before his death in 1948, Richard Atwater was a newspaper columnist and a professor of Greek. He is best known for writing <em>Mr. Popper's Penguins </em>with his wife, Florence, who finished the novel when he fell ill.

In this insightful new book, John Eldredge presents the heart as central to life. Not only is the heart essential; the heart God has ransomed is also good. Building on these foundational truths, Eldredge shows readers why real Christianity is a process of restoration, where the broken parts of our hearts are mended and the captive parts are set free. Waking the Dead leads listeners to understand how to live from the heart, care for their heart like the treasures of the kingdom, and give from fullness instead of emptiness. This message also shows how living from the heart can energize people to love God and others in a way they&#39;ve never experienced, revealing to them life&#39;s purpose: fighting for the hearts of others.</p><p>John Eldredge is the founder and director of Ransomed Heart Ministries in Colorado Springs, Colorado, a fellowship devoted to helping people recover and live from their heart. John is the author of numerous books, including <i>Epic</i>, <i>Waking the Dead</i>, <i>Wild at Heart</i>, <i>The Sacred Romance</i>, and <i>The Journey of Desire</i>. John lives in Colorado with his wife, Stasi, and their three sons, Samuel, Blaine, and Luke. He loves living in the Rocky Mountains so he can pursue his other passions, including fly-fishing, mountain climbing, and exploring the waters of the West in his canoe.chapter one <p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> Arm Yourselves<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy;<p></p> I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.<p></p> &#x2014;Jesus of Nazareth (John 10:10)<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> We and the world, my children, will always be at war.<p></p> Retreat is impossible.<p></p> Arm yourselves.<p></p> &#x2014;Leif Enger<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> We were running low on fuel, and still the fog refused to lift. Icy Straight spread out below us, beautiful and threatening. I&#x2019;ve always loved the ocean, the wilder the better. But clearly, this was no place to run out of gas. If by chance we survived ditching the small plane, we&#x2019;d last about seven minutes in those waters. The nearest chance at rescue lived more than forty minutes away. <i>Great. This is just how it happens,</i> I thought. <i>We&#x2019;ll make </i>Reader&#x2019;s Digest<i>. &#x201c;Family on vacation lost in fatal crash</i>.<i>&#x201d;</i> Rain and mist smeared the windshield as we strained our eyes ahead, searching for a break in the clouds. There&#x2019;s no radar in these planes; bush pilots fly VFR&#x2014;visual flight restrictions. If you can&#x2019;t see where you&#x2019;re going, well, then, mister, you can&#x2019;t go there. And you can&#x2019;t keep trying forever, either; the clock that&#x2019;s running is the fuel gauge. Three more minutes, and we&#x2019;ll have to turn back. <p></p> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll give it one more pass.&#x201d;<p></p> &#x201c;Fairweather Mountain&#x201d; is a total misnomer. With a name like that, don&#x2019;t you picture some lovely place in Hawaii or maybe Costa Rica&#x2014;balmy breezes, gentle green slopes, the weather always, well, <i>fair</i>? These mountains explode 15,000 feet or more above sea level, right off the coast of southeastern Alaska, sheer cliffs and foreboding glaciers. Some of the world&#x2019;s worst weather hangs out here.<p></p> The pilot was yelling above the drone of the engine, &#x201c;They get their name &#x2019;cause you can only see &#x2019;em in fair weather.&#x201d; <p></p> <i>How cute.</i> <i>What idiot came up with that cleverness?</i> Raw fear had swallowed my sense of humor whole.<i> They ought to have named them the Peaks of Frozen Death or the Don&#x2019;t Even Think About It Mountains</i>. Fair weather? Around here, that means maybe twenty days a year&#x2014;if you&#x2019;re lucky. <p></p> We got lucky.<p></p> And I have never seen anything more breathtaking in all my life. We banked along vertical granite walls that rose and fell thousands of feet on either side, like a sparrow gliding among the Himalayas. &#x201c;Are those waterfalls?&#x201d; I asked, pointing to several cascades of white falling through thin air over the black cliffs.<p></p> &#x201c;Avalanches. It must be warm up here today.&#x201d; <p></p> Massive crevasses in the glaciers below held pools of clear water&#x2014;a color I never knew existed, something between azure and cerulean blue.<p></p> &#x201c;Those cracks are so big we could fly right down &#x2019;em.&#x201d; <p></p> I pretended not to hear. I felt we&#x2019;d slipped through Death&#x2019;s grasp, and I didn&#x2019;t want to give him another swipe. The beauty that now engulfed us was enough. <p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> In Desperate Need of Clarity &nbsp;<p></p> Twenty clear days a year&#x2014;that sounds about like my life. I think I see what&#x2019;s really going on about that often. The rest of the time, it feels like fog, like the bathroom mirror after a hot shower. You know what I mean. What exactly are you perfectly clear on these days? How about your life? Why have things gone the way they have? Where was God in all that? And do you know what you ought to do next, with a deep, settled confidence that it will work out? Neither do I. Oh, I&#x2019;d <i>love</i> to wake each morning knowing exactly who I am and where God is taking me. Zeroed in on all my relationships, undaunted in my calling. It&#x2019;s awesome when I do see. But for most of us, life seems more like driving along with a dirty windshield and then turning into the sun. I can sort of make out the shapes ahead, and I think the light is green. <p></p> Wouldn&#x2019;t a little bit of clarity go a long way right now? <p></p> Let&#x2019;s start with why life is so dang <i>hard.</i> You try to lose a little weight, but it never seems to happen. You think of making a shift in your career, maybe even serving God, but you never actually get to it. Perhaps a few of you do make the jump, but it rarely pans out the way you thought. You try to recover something in your marriage, and your spouse looks at you with a glance that says, &#x201c;Nice try,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it a little late for that?&#x201d; and the thing actually blows up into an argument in front of the kids. Yes, we have our faith. But even there&#x2014;maybe <i>especially</i> there&#x2014;it all seems to fall rather short of the promise. There&#x2019;s talk of freedom and abundant life, of peace like a river and joy unspeakable, but we see precious little of it, to be honest. <p></p> Why is it that, as Tillich said, it&#x2019;s only &#x201c;here and there in the world and now and then in ourselves&#x201d; we see any evidence of a new creation? Here and there, now and then. In other words . . . not much. When you stand them side by side, the <i>description</i> of the Christian life practically shouted in the New Testament compared with the <i>actual</i> life of most Christians, it&#x2019;s . . . embarrassing. Paul sounds like a madman, and we look a little foolish, like children who&#x2019;ve been held back a grade. Why is it that nearly every good thing, from taking the annual family vacation to planning a wedding to cultivating a relationship, takes so much work? <p></p> It&#x2019;s almost as if there is something set against us. <p></p> Shell Shock<p></p>Some dear friends of mine just returned from a three-week vacation in France. It had been their dream for nearly twenty-five years. What could be more romantic than strolling the Champs �lys�es in the evening, as lovers do? It seemed an ideal way to celebrate their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. They&#x2019;d both served God faithfully for decades, but over the years a European rendezvous seemed about as reachable as the moon. Then, late last fall, things suddenly came together. Friends of theirs were headed to Europe and offered two tickets to come along. Time off was available. They were going to France. And right after they made it to Paris, it all fell apart. Craig came down with walking pneumonia; Lori wanted to leave the third day. All sorts of issues in their marriage surfaced, but since they were with friends, the issues mostly played themselves out in their own thoughts&#x2014;which tended toward divorce. It wasn&#x2019;t romantic; it was <i>hard</i>. Afterward, as we talked on the phone about the whole thing, Lori said, &#x201c;Life never seems to turn out the way you think it will, about 90 percent of the time.&#x201d; No kidding. Haven&#x2019;t we all got a story that goes with that little bumper sticker?<p></p> Just the day before, I received another call. That was the morning our son Blaine was to have his final cardiologist appointment, and I was anxious to hear the news. Now, I know that every parent thinks his child is head and shoulders above the rest, but I&#x2019;m telling you&#x2014;Blaine is a special one. He turned eleven this year, and he&#x2019;s one of the healthiest, happiest kids I&#x2019;ve ever known. His heart is so good, so spiritually aware, so keen to the hearts of others. He&#x2019;s surprisingly compassionate for a boy his age, and he&#x2019;s also the most courageous one of us all. When it comes to rock climbing or cliff jumping or skiing, Blaine is always the first to go for it. He&#x2019;s a great athlete and a talented artist and a riot when it comes to his humor. He plays the violin; he memorizes cowboy poetry; he blows stuff up; he wants to be a Jedi knight. I love this boy.<p></p> And it&#x2019;s a long story of prayer and hope and worry over Blaine. When he was young, his pediatrician picked up an anomaly in his heart during a routine checkup. The cardiologist confirmed through a battery of tests that, indeed, Blaine had several holes in his heart. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll need surgery,&#x201d; he said. We opted to wait until Blaine was older, to give God a chance to intervene. The thought of putting my son under open-heart surgery gave me the shudders.<p></p> Over the course of those years we spent many nights in prayer that God would heal Blaine&#x2019;s heart. During one of those times, Stasi, not usually given to visions, had a picture of a light penetrating his heart. At that moment, she felt certain God had healed him. And just this morning, the day for his annual checkup, as I began to pray for Blaine, I sensed Jesus say, <i>I&#x2019;ve healed him</i>. My heart rested, and I waited for the good report.<p></p> &#x201c;Hi . . . it&#x2019;s me.&#x201d; A long silence. &#x201c;Blaine needs surgery . . . right away.&#x201d;<p></p> Hope vanished. I felt that sick-in-the-gut feeling of an imminent free fall, that feeling you get on top of a ladder that&#x2019;s starting to sway under you. All kinds of thoughts and emotions rushed in. <i>What? Oh, no . . . Not after all this . . . I . . . I thought . . . </i>My heart was sinking. Despair, betrayal, abandonment by God. Failure on our part to pray enough or believe enough. I felt moments away from a total loss of heart. It seemed inevitable. <p></p> These moments aren&#x2019;t a rational, calculated progression of thought; they&#x2019;re more like being tossed out of a raft in a storm. It comes fast and furious, but the pull of the current is always toward a loss of heart. Most of the time we are swept away; we give in, lose heart, and climb out of it sometime later. Some never climb out.<p></p> Eyes to See<p></p>When Spillane (<i>The Perfect Storm</i>) treats injured seamen offshore, one of the first things he evaluates is their degree of consciousness. The highest level, known as &#x201c;alert and oriented times four,&#x201d; describes almost everyone in an everyday situation. They know who they are, where they are, what time it is, and what&#x2019;s just happened. If someone suffers a blow to the head, the first thing they lose is recent events&#x2014;&#x201c;alert and oriented times three&#x201d;&#x2014;and the last thing they lose is their identity. A person who has lost all levels of consciousness, right down to their identity, is said to be &#x201c;alert and oriented times zero.&#x201d; When John Spillane wakes up in the water, he is alert and oriented times zero. His understanding of the world is reduced to the fact that he exists, nothing more. Almost simultaneously, he understands that he is in excruciating pain. For a long time, that is all he knows. John Spillane is a para-rescue jumper sent into the North Atlantic, into the worst storm of the twentieth century, the <i>perfect storm,</i> as the book and film called it, to rescue a fisherman lost at sea. When his helicopter goes down, he is forced to jump into pitch blackness from an unknown height, and when he hits the water, he&#x2019;s going so fast it&#x2019;s like hitting the pavement from eighty feet above. He is dazed and confused&#x2014;just as we are when it comes to the story of our lives. It&#x2019;s the perfect analogy. We have no idea who we really are, why we&#x2019;re here, what&#x2019;s happened to us, or why. Honestly, most days we are alert and oriented times zero.<p></p> Has God abandoned us? Did we not pray enough? Is this just something we accept as &#x201c;part of life,&#x201d; suck it up, even though it breaks our hearts? After a while, the accumulation of event after event that we do not like and do not understand erodes our confidence that we are part of something grand and good, and reduces us to a survivalist mind-set. I know, I know&#x2014;we&#x2019;ve been told that we matter to God. And part of us partly believes it. But life has a way of chipping away at that conviction, undermining our settled belief that he means us well. I mean, if that&#x2019;s true, then why didn&#x2019;t&nbsp; he _______ ? Fill in the blank. Heal your mom. Save your marriage. Get you married. Help you out more. <p></p> Either (<i>a</i>) we&#x2019;re blowing it, or (<i>b</i>) God is holding out on us. Or some combination of both, which is where most people land. Think about it. Isn&#x2019;t this where <i>you</i> land, with all the things that haven&#x2019;t gone the way you&#x2019;d hoped and wanted? Isn&#x2019;t it some version of &#x201c;I&#x2019;m blowing it&#x201d;? in that it&#x2019;s your fault, you could have done better, you could have been braver or wiser or more beautiful or something? Or &#x201c;God is holding out on me,&#x201d; in that you know he <i>could</i> come through, but he hasn&#x2019;t come through&#x2014;and what are you to make of that? <p></p> This is The Big Question, by the way, the one every philosophy and religion and denominational take on Christianity has been trying to nail down since the dawn of time. <i>What is really going on here?</i> Good grief&#x2014;life is brutal. Day after day it hammers us, till we lose sight of what God intends toward us, and we haven&#x2019;t the foggiest idea why the things that are happening to us <i>are</i> happening to us. Then you watch lives going down with the Twin Towers, read about children starving in Ethiopia, and wham! If a good God is really in charge . . . all that.<p></p> I felt so bad that Paris wasn&#x2019;t what my friends hoped it would be, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure what to say. Like most Christians in that situation, I simply asked Lori how I could pray for them. &#x201c;That we would have eyes to see what&#x2019;s going on.&#x201d; My heart leaped. Brilliant! Perfect! That is <i>exactly</i> what we need. Eyes to see. Isn&#x2019;t that what Jesus offered us&#x2014;clarity? Recovery of sight for the blind (Luke 4:18)? We need clarity and we need it badly. A simple prayer rises from my heart: <i>Jesus, take away the fog and the clouds and the veil, and help me to see . . . give me eyes to really see.</i><p></p> The Offer Is <i>Life</i><p></p> The glory of God is man fully alive. (Saint Irenaeus) &nbsp;<p></p> When I first stumbled across this quote, my initial reaction was . . . <i>You&#x2019;re kidding me. Really?</i> I mean, is that what you&#x2019;ve been told? That the purpose of God&#x2014;the very thing he&#x2019;s staked his reputation on&#x2014;is your coming fully alive? Huh. Well, that&#x2019;s a different take on things. It made me wonder, <i>What </i>are<i> God&#x2019;s intentions toward me? What is it I&#x2019;ve come to believe about that?</i> Yes, we&#x2019;ve been told any number of times that God does care, and there are some pretty glowing promises given to us in Scripture along those lines. But on the other hand, we have the days of our lives, and they have a way of casting a rather long shadow over our hearts when it comes to God&#x2019;s intentions toward <i>us</i> in particular. I read the quote again, &#x201c;The glory of God is man fully alive,&#x201d; and something began to stir in me. <i>Could it be?</i><p></p> I turned to the New Testament to have another look, read for myself what Jesus said he offers. &#x201c;I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full&#x201d; (John 10:10). Wow. That&#x2019;s different from saying, &#x201c;I have come to forgive you. Period.&#x201d; Forgiveness is awesome, but Jesus says here he came to give us <i>life</i>. Hmmm. Sounds like ol&#x2019; Irenaeus might be on to something. &#x201c;I am the bread of life&#x201d; (John 6:48). &#x201c;Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him&#x201d; (John 7:38). The more I looked, the more this whole theme of life jumped off the pages. I mean, it&#x2019;s <i>everywhere</i>.<p></p> Above all else, guard your heart,<p></p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for it is the wellspring of life. (Prov. 4:23)<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> You have made known to me the path of life. (Ps. 16:11)<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> In him was life, and that life was the light of men. (John 1:4)<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> Come to me to have life. (John 5:40)<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> Tell the people the full message of this new life.

The wealth and range of its collections is unequalled by any other national museum. The Rosetta Stone, the Parthenon sculptures, Egyptian mummies, drawings by Botticelli and Michelangelo, Assyrian reliefs, the Lewis Chessmen and the Sutton Hoo treasure are all to be found here. Treasures of the British Museum reveals and delights the reader with the intriguing stories behind these treasures and many more. This timely new edition brings the story up to date, with chapters on important acquisitions made by the Museum in the last fifteen years, including the Warren Cup and the &#39;Queen of the Night&#39;. A beautiful redesign incorporating full colour photography throughout gives this classic volume a fresh new look.</p><p>Marjorie Caygill has published numerous books and articles about the history of the British Museum and the collections. These include The Story of the British Museum, The British Museum Reading Room and The British Museum: 250 Years.While these books are similar in scope, each is unique. Treasures of the British Museum captures the diversity and international flavor of the world's greatest museum. Focusing on eight broad areas of the collection, Caygill shares historical background and anecdotal stories about many key items, from the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles to the flower mosaics of Mary Delany. Richly illustrated by Lee Boltin, Treasures offers but a glimpse into this ever-growing, fascinating collection. Treasures of the Hood Museum of Art , on the other hand, commemorates the opening of the new facility on the Dartmouth College campus and records the evolution of that collection from its beginnings in 1773 to the present. Honoring a more recent tradition in the collection of quality art works than the British Museum, the Hood Museum has much to be proud of, from Assyrian bas-relief panels to murals by Orozco. Also featured are architect Charles Moore's plans of the facility, as well as illustrations of 150 masterworks from the collection and corresponding descriptive data. From the known greatness of the British Museum to the unsung greatness of the Hood Museum, both Treasures share insights into important collections, and both are recommended.

The group, whose ballot symbol was a snarling black panther, was formed in part to protest the barriers to black enfranchisement that had for decades kept every single African American of voting age off the county&#x2019;s registration books. Even after the passage of the Voting Rights Act, most African Americans in this overwhelmingly black county remained too scared even to try to register. Their fear stemmed from the county&#x2019;s long, bloody history of whites retaliating against blacks who strove to exert the freedom granted to them after the Civil War.</p><p>Amid this environment of intimidation and disempowerment, African Americans in Lowndes County viewed the LCFO as the best vehicle for concrete change. Their radical experiment in democratic politics inspired black people throughout the country, from SNCC organizer Stokely Carmichael who used the Lowndes County program as the blueprint for Black Power, to California-based activists Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton, who adopted the LCFO panther as the namesake for their new, grassroots organization: the Black Panther Party for Self Defense. This party and its adopted symbol went on to become the national organization of black militancy in the 1960s and 1970s, yet long-obscured is the crucial role that Lowndes County&#x201c;historically a bastion of white supremacy&#x201d;played in spurring black activists nationwide to fight for civil and human rights in new and more radical ways.</p><p>Drawing on an impressive array of sources ranging from government documents to personal interviews with Lowndes County residents and SNCC activists, Hasan Kwame Jeffries tells, for the first time, the remarkable full story of the Lowndes County freedom struggle and its contribution to the larger civil rights movement. Bridging the gaping hole in the literature between civil rights organizing and Black Power politics, <b>Bloody Lowndes</b> offers a new paradigm for understanding the civil rights movement.</p></p><p><p><b>Hasan Kwame Jeffries</b> is Associate Professor of History at The Ohio State University, where he holds a joint appointment at the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity.</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Bloody Lowndes</em> is an important book.

His beautifully written account rescues Lowndes County from its role as merely a backdrop to &#x2018;Black Power,&#x2019; to being one of the key battlegrounds for democracy in the United States. Here are local people whose local struggles have contributed mightily to the kind of politics we desperately need in the Obama age&#x2014;the politics of &#x2018;freedom democracy,&#x2019; a politics born in Reconstruction, rooted in social justice and human rights, and honed in the Alabama cotton belt.&#x201d;<br> -Robin D. G. Kelley,author of <i>Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination</i></p><br><br>"Jeffries' book sets a new standard for the political history of African Americans in the rural South by refocusing on the mechanics of power taken, used, lost, and retaken between blacks and whites, rather than the larger fabric of social and cultural politics.

Jeffries reveals the deep historical roots of black struggles against racial and economic oppression in the Black Belt.

My mother boils another pot of basil tea on our village&#x2019;s clay stove in the courtyard. Voices of our neighbors gathered around her flow through the open door of our home. <br>&#x201c;Here&#x2014;papaya juice with honey.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Have you tried raisins with ginger? Boil them together and have her drink the liquid.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Take these onions, Parvati. When my son had a fever, I made him onion broth.&#x201d; <br>September marked the end of monsoon season, but an October rain flooded the river near our village last week. We all worried about the humming of mosquitoes that followed the water. Sometimes mosquitoes carry fever. <br>Sometimes the fever is stronger than a cold washcloth and basil tea and onions. <br>One of the fever-mosquitoes must have bitten my little sister, because she&#x2019;s been sick for five days. She is too tired to get up from her blanket. She does not want to eat or drink, not even fresh milk mixed with sugar. <br>Our mother enters the hut, holding a tea glass and a wooden bowl. She sets the tea glass next to me and kneels on the other side of Chanda. <br>&#x201c;Neera made you papaya juice with honey. This will help you feel better.&#x201d; <br>She puts one hand behind Chanda&#x2019;s head and brings the bowl to her lips. Carefully she pours some papaya juice into Chanda&#x2019;s mouth. <br>&#x201c;My head hurts, Amma.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;One more sip.&#x201d; She gives her another taste, then sets the bowl down and lowers Chanda&#x2019;s head to the blanket. <br>&#x201c;Should we take her to a doctor, Amma?&#x201d; I whisper. <br>She does not answer. <br>&#x201c;I know we have no money, but&#x2026;&#x201d; Ever since Baba died last year, I feel like my family is sliding down a hill of sand, clawing and grabbing for anything to hang on to. <br>&#x201c;She will get better, Hastin,&#x201d; Amma says, but her eyes do not leave Chanda&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;The fever will break with the next glass of tea, or with another good night&#x2019;s sleep. And everyone is praying she will get well,&#x201d; she adds. <br>They pray she will get well but speak like she will not. <br>I don&#x2019;t tell Amma about the neighbor who whispered to her husband last night as they left our hut. &#x201c;How sad for Parvati,&#x201d; she had said. &#x201c;First her husband, and now to lose her little girl&#x2026;&#x201d; The man quieted his wife after he glanced back at me. <br>&#x201c;Keep giving her the juice and the tea. While I&#x2019;m making dinner I&#x2019;ll boil some onions for broth.&#x201d; Amma touches Chanda&#x2019;s face and forces a smile. &#x201c;She is getting better, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d; <br> <i>No, I don&#x2019;t.</i> I want to grab Amma&#x2019;s shoulders and shake her and yell, <i>Can&#x2019;t you see she&#x2019;s getting worse? Do something! Make her better!</i> But she has some hope left and I don&#x2019;t want to take it away. <br>She stands and hurries back to the courtyard. <br>Next to me, a fire burns in a mud-plastered bucket. A metal grill lies across the top of it. I set the tea glass on the grill so the fire will keep it warm. Once again, I dip the washcloth into a bowl of cold water, then place it across Chanda&#x2019;s forehead. Her chest moves up and down as she sleeps. <br>My stomach growls when I smell the roti dough baking in the clay oven outside. <br>I hope we will eat dinner soon&#x2014;the flatbread tastes best when I pour the buttermilk on while it is still hot. Maybe we will even have beans tonight. <br>The sun dips lower in the sky, and the hut grows dark. Too early to light the lamp, though. From the wooden trunk that holds my belongings, I grab the ball Amma made me from fabric scraps and take it outside. Amma sits in front of the courtyard stove, covering her face with the end of her sari as gray smoke billows toward her. <br>Raj runs to me with his tail wagging. Chanda and I found him one day, drinking from the puddle around the water pump. He was so thin we could see his ribs beneath his sand-colored fur. <br>Amma wouldn&#x2019;t let us keep him. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t need one more mouth to feed!&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said when we asked her. But Raj doesn&#x2019;t have anyone else. When Amma isn&#x2019;t watching, Chanda and I bring him some of our dinner or a cup of milk. We shrug and try to look puzzled when she asks, &#x201c;Why is that dog always following you around?&#x201d; <br>Amma saw me petting Raj last week after I gave him a bite of roti. &#x201c;The dog is getting fatter since you found him,&#x201d; she said, but I think she smiled a little. <br>From the doorway I throw the ball over and over again as far as I can, and Raj chases it and brings it back to me. He could play this game all day long. <br>&#x201c;Amma?&#x201d; <br>I let the ball drop to the ground and turn toward Chanda&#x2019;s voice. I rush into the house and kneel next to her, then brush back the wet strands of hair matted against her face. Raj follows me into the hut and nudges me with the ball before setting it down next to me. <br>&#x201c;Chanda, are you feeling better?&#x201d; Raj licks her face as I take the tea glass from the grill of the bucket fire. &#x201c;Here, have some more tea.&#x201d; <br>She pushes the glass away. <br>&#x201c;Do you want to rest in your playhouse?&#x201d; I ask her. Chanda&#x2019;s always asking me to set up her playhouse for her. It&#x2019;s her favorite place to play with her doll or listen to stories I tell her. <br>She doesn&#x2019;t answer, but I grab two wooden trunks anyway and drag them across the floor. Then I set one near her head and one at her feet. From Amma&#x2019;s trunk I grab a purple sari, Chanda&#x2019;s favorite color, and drape it across the trunks to make a ceiling. The lamp I light shines through the fabric and makes a sunset on the wall. <br>Now and then I place a hand behind Chanda&#x2019;s head to help her take a drink. Finally she tilts the tea glass against her mouth for the last sip, then hands me the empty glass. I lean over to kiss her forehead. Still warm, but maybe not as burning hot as before. I run to the courtyard to tell Amma. <br>Just as I start to fall asleep that night I dream that Baba is playing catch with me and Raj. But then Chanda&#x2019;s voice pulls me away. <br>&#x201c;Hastin, it&#x2019;s too hot.&#x201d; <br>I open my eyes and turn toward Chanda, where she lies on her blanket. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m awake, what is it?&#x201d; I ask. After Baba died, Chanda started having nightmares. When that happens I hold her hand until she falls asleep again. &#x201c;Did you have a bad dream?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m burning up.&#x201d; <br>I crawl to her and touch her forehead, then hurry over to my mother. <br>&#x201c;Amma, wake up!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What is it, Hastin? I am so tired,&#x201d; she says. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Chanda.&#x201d; <br>Amma sits up and flings off her blanket. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; She races to Chanda and puts her hand on her cheek before I can answer. &#x201c;Her fever is worse than before!&#x201d; Amma lights a lamp from a nearby shelf. The lamplight reveals spots of red covering Chanda&#x2019;s face and hands. <i>Oh, please, no&nbsp;&#x2026;</i> <br>We have seen others break out in red spots after a bite from a fever-mosquito. If they get to the doctor in time, sometimes they get well and come back. Sometimes. <br>&#x201c;What can we do, Amma?&#x201d; I ask. <br>She picks up Chanda, limp like a doll in her arms. &#x201c;I will take her to Amar&#x2019;s and ask him for a ride to the hospital.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I want to go with you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, stay here and take care of things. I&#x2019;ll be back as soon as I can.&#x201d; She carries Chanda across the courtyard to our neighbor Amar&#x2019;s house. He owns a rickshaw, so he can get them to the hospital in the city faster than anyone else. <br>&#x201c;Amma, will she be all right?&#x201d; I wait for her to give me some hope to cling to, to tell me again, <i>She will get better.</i> <br>She stops and turns to me. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Hastin.

After all, getting two numbers in your age is the beginning of growing up&#x2014;exciting things are bound to happen. And they do! The girls fall in love with the King of Spain, perform in the School Entertainment, and for the first time, go all the way over the Big Hill to Little Syria by themselves. There Betsy, Tacy, and Tib make new friends and learn a thing or two. They learn that new Americans are sometimes the best Americans. And they learn that they themselves wouldn't want to be anything else. </p> <p>Ever since their first publication in the 1940s, the Betsy-Tacy stories have been loved by each generation of young readers. </p></p><p><p>Maud Hart Lovelace (1892-1980) based her Betsy-Tacy series on her own childhood. Her series still boasts legions of fans, many of whom are members of the Betsy-Tacy Society, a national organization based in Mankato, Minnesota.</p><br><br>In addition to illustrating the first four Betsy-Tacy books, Lois Lenski (1893-1974) was the 1946 Newberry Medal winning author of <em>Strawberry Girl</em>.<p>Chapter One &nbsp;</p><p> Getting to Be Ten </p><p>Betsy, Tacy, and Tib were nine years old, and they were very anxious to be ten. </p><p>"You have two numbers in your age when you are ten. It's the beginning of growing up," Betsy would say. </p><p>Then the three of them felt solemn and important and pleased. They could hardly wait for their birthdays. </p><p>It was strange that Betsy and Tacy and Tib were in such a hurry to grow up, for they had so much fun being children. Betsy and Tacy lived on Hill Street which ran straight up into a green hill and stopped. The small yellow cottage where Betsy Ray lived was the last house on that side of the street, and the rambling white house opposite where Tacy Kelly lived was the last house on that side. They had the whole hill for a playground. And not Just that one green slope. There were hills all around them. Hills like a half-opened fan rose in the east behind Betsy's house. Beyond the town and across the river where the sun set there were more hills. The name of the town was Deep Valley. </p><p>Tib didn't live on Hill Street. To get to Tib's house from the place where Betsy and Tacy lived, you went one block down and one block over. (The second block was through a vacant lot.) But Tib lived near enough to come to play with Betsy and Tacy. She came every day. </p><p>"They certainly have fun, those three," Betsy's mother used to say to Betsy's father. </p><p>They did, too. </p><p>Betsy's big sister Julia played with Tacy's sister Katie, but they didn't have so much fun as Betsy and Tacy and Tib had. They were too grown-up. They were twelve. </p><p>Betsy's little sister Margaret, Tacy's younger brother Paul, and Tib's yellow-headed brothers, Freddie and Hobbie, had fun all right, but not so much fun as Betsy and Tacy and Tib had. They were too little. </p><p>Going on ten seemed to be exactly the right age for having fun. But just the same Betsy and Tacy and Tib wanted to be ten years old. </p><p>They were getting near it now. Betsy and Tacy were growing tall, so that their mothers were kept busy lengthening their dresses. Tib wasn't as tiny as she used to be, but she was still tiny. She still looked like a picture-book fairy. The three girls had cut their hair when they were eight years old and didn't know any better, but it had grown out. Tib's curls once more made a yellow fluff around her little face. Tacy had her long red ringlets and Betsy had her braids again. </p><p>"When I'm ten," said Betsy, "I'm going to cross my braids in back and tie them with ribbons." </p><p>"I'm going to tie my hair at my neck with a big blue bow," Tacy replied. </p><p>"We can't put it up in pugs quite yet, I suppose," Betsy said. </p><p>"But pretty soon we can," said Tacy. "On top of our heads." </p><p>Tib did not make plans like that. She never did. </p><p>"I only hope," she said, "that when I get to be ten years old people will stop taking me for a baby." </p><p>For people always thought that Tib was younger than she was. And she didn't like it a bit. </p><p>Tacy got to be ten first because her birthday came in January. They didn't have many birthday parties at Tacy's house. There were too many children in the family. Mrs. Kelly would have been giving birthday parties every month in the year, almost, if every child at the Kelly house had had a party every birthday. But when Tacy was ten, Betsy and Tib were invited to supper. There was a cake with candles on it. </p><p>Tacy didn't look any different or feel any different. </p><p>But she knew why that was. Betsy and Tib weren't ten yet. </p><p>"We'll all have to get to be ten before it really counts, I suppose," Tacy said. </p><p>Tib got to be ten next because her birthday came in March. Tib didn't have a birthday party; she had the grippe instead. But she was given a bicycle, and her mother sent pieces of birthday cake over to Betsy and Tacy. </p><p>And Tib didn't look any different or feel any different. But she didn't expect much change until Betsy got to be ten. And Betsy's birthday didn't come until April. </p><p>Tacy and Tib didn't say very much about being ten. They were too polite. They talked about presents and birthday cakes, but they didn't mention having two numbers in their age. They didn't talk about beginning to grow up until the afternoon before Betsy's birthday. </p><p>That afternoon after school they all went up on the Big Hill hunting for violets. It was one of those April days on which it seemed that summer had already come, although the ground was still muddy and brown. The sun was shining so warmly that Betsy, Tacy, and Tib pulled off their stocking caps and unbuttoned their coats. Birds in the bare trees were singing with all their might, and Betsy, Tacy, and Tib sang too as they climbed the Big Hill. </p><p>They sang to the tune of "Mine eyes have seen the glory," but they made up the words themselves:</p><i><p>"Oh, Betsy's ten tomorrow, <br>And then all of us are ten, <br>We will all grow up tomorrow, <br>We will all be ladies then..."</p></i></p><h2>Wilderness by Design: Landscape Architecture and the National Park Service</h2><p>Tracing the history of landscape park design from British gardens up through the city park designs of Frederick Law Olmsted, Ethan Carr places national park landscape architecture within a larger historical context.

And like the earlier novels in his historical cycle, <b>Empire</b> is a wonderfully vivid documentary drama." &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>In this extraordinarily powerful epic Gore Vidal recreates America's Gilded Age&#x2014;a period of promise and possibility, of empire-building and fierce political rivalries. In a vivid and beathtaking work of fiction, where the fortunes of a sister and brother intertwine with the fates of the generation, their country, and some of the greatest names of their day, including President McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, William Jennings Bryan, William and Henry James, the Astors, the Vanderbilts, and the Whitneys, Gore Vidal sweeps us from the nineteenth century into the twentieth, from the salvaged republic of Lincoln to a nation boldly reaching for the world.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Gore Vidal was at the centre of literary and intellectual life for half a century and wrote &#39;The Narratives of a Golden Age&#39; series as well as countless bestsellers. He died on 31st July 2012.Fictional creation Caroline Sanford, owner of the Washington Tribune, is the central character in this historical novel that focuses on late 19th/early 20th century America's emergence as a global power. A well-written tale in the tradition of the author's Burr and 1876, it encompasses the Spanish-American War of 1898, U.S. takeover of the Philippines, President McKinley's assassination, and the stormy presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. Interesting and well-developed real-life characters abound, including, most memorably, Secretary of State and Lincoln's old friend John Hay. Intermixed with the well-researched backdrop of historical characters and events is Caroline's personal story. The fifth novel in Vidal's "American Chronicle" series, this is yet another winner.

The condensation all but eliminates descriptive passages and fails to develop characters such as Ben Weatherstaff, Susan Sowerby, and Archibald Craven. The time from Colin's entry into the garden through his recovery is severely compressed. Nor can the illustrations earn a purchase recommendation on their own merits. Figures are stiff and lifeless, and the colors are unappealing. In the final painting, for example, the complexions of all the characters are a sickly green. Adults who want to share their own remembered enjoyment of Burnett's work with their children would be well advised to read the original aloud to young listeners or wait until they are old enough to read the complete novel themselves. --Kathy Piehl, Mankato State University, MN<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Stein Book: Illustrated Catalog, Current Prices, Collector&#39;s Information</h2><p>Chapters in this 332-page book include: Stein History; Production of Steins; Early Stoneware; Faience; Pewter; Glass; Unusual Materials; Porcelain; Mettlach; Other Etched Ceramics; Pottery and Stoneware; Occupationals; Regimentals; Characters; a Bibliography, Reference, and Appendices.

Erudite, unpretentious, and suited for a wide audience of students, teachers, and browsers. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>This handsome, oversized volume is more than just an "album" of maps. It has them in abundance, hundreds of them, from reproductions of 17th-century maps to so phisticated contemporary cartograms, and it uses them to collect in one accessible place information usually scattered through diverse sources. The often complex matters of settlement patterns, population dynamics, economic development, and political trends are here presented with clear graphic simplicity. If you need to know what constituted the colonial triangular trade or where the Lowell mill girls came from, or what the present fertility and mortality rate are, this book pro vides your answer. As in any work of such scope, there are quibbles, such as the pedestrian text and a slight overemphasis on current affairs, but there is also much to commend, especially the diversity of topics covered and the excellent color illustrations. A splendid work, sure to be much consulted in Massachusetts libraries, and worthy of serious consider ation in large libraries elsewhere.<br><i>- Charles Michaud, Turner Free Lib., Randolph, Mass.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Devil You Know (Felix Castor, 1)</h2><p><b>Author of <i>The Girl With All the Gifts </i>Mike Carey presents the first book in his hip supernatural thriller series featuring freelance exorcist Felix Castor.</b><br>Felix Castor is a freelance exorcist, and London is his stomping ground.

As a work of visual art, it is a triumph. As a novel, it is a triumph.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;Jonathan Safran Foer, author of <em>Everything is Illuminated</em></strong></p><p>"This is my whole life," Charlotte Salomon said when she gave her doctor and friend the enormous suitcase containing her life&#x2019;s work for safekeeping. <em>Life? Or theatre?</em> is the result of months of restless work in a small room in a hostel during which Charlotte Salomon appealed to everything inside her: her perfect visual memory, her insight into family and friends, her education at the Art Academy in Berlin and, most of all, the inspiration of her short but intense love for her stepmother&#x2019;s singing teacher.</p><p>That is how Charlotte created this singular work of art, a graphic novel <em>avant la lettre</em>, consisting of 781 gouaches and hundreds of drawings&#x2015;a mixture of paintings, texts, and musical annotations&#x2015;which together tell the story of a family between World War I and 1940. In more than one gouache, influences of George Grosz and Modigliani are recognizable, while others are foretastes of the contemporary graphic novel. The work shimmers with beauty and precision. This timeless masterpiece, now published for the first time in a complete edition including several recently discovered gouaches, is truly a unique work by an artist whose life inspired not only David Foenkinos&#x2019;s internationally bestselling novel <em>Charlotte</em>&nbsp;but also a movie, a documentary, an opera and a ballet.</p><p>Sold in an elegantly printed box, this deluxe edition contains over 1,300 color illustrations as well as illuminating essays on Charlotte Salomon's life and work by a close friend of the Salomon family and by curators of past exhibitions of Salomon's artwork.

Or theatre?</em>&nbsp;is truly the definitive collection of Charlotte Salomon's work.</p> Over 1,300 color illustrations</p><p>Charlotte Salomon (Berlin 1917-Auschwitz 1943) was the only child of surgeon Albert Salomon and Fr�nze Grunwald, and was raised in an assimilated Jewish family. In 1935, she was admitted to the Art Academy. When the persecution of Jews intensified after the Kristallnacht, she fled to her grandparents in France. After the beginning of the war, she and her grandfather were sent to the camp Gurs, in the Pyrenees. In July they were allowed, because of his advanced age, to return to Nice, where a doctor advised Charlotte to start again with her creative work as a way to help process her experiences; tragedy, death, her world collapsing around her, she completed Life?

But, grown-up competition for success is rough, even cutthroat, and we've often heard that nice guys finish last.<br> Not according to Howard Behar, whose career as one of the three leaders who built the Starbucks organization most definitely proves that nice guys finish first. In THE MAGIC CUP, Behar spins an engaging corporate tale to teach us exactly how we can do the same thing. <br> The story revolves around Vince Steadfast, the newly named CEO of imaginary manufacturer Verity Glassworks, which has fallen on difficult times. Vince is hired to help the once iconic company return to its glory days, and he brings with him a parting gift from his mentor and former boss: a stunning crystal coffee cup from Verity's halcyon days. The cup turns out to be magic - truly - and helps him come to understand and reinvigorate the values that Verity has misplaced along the way.<br> As Vince and his new team make their way to (and through) many challenges, including the aptly named Worthy Way, Perilous Passage and Arduous Stair, the cup fills with a gold elixir and the universal truths that they learn to embrace - such as Responsibility, Forgiveness and Courage - magically become engraved in the glass. <br><br> In the tradition of great parable writers throughout history, Behar quickly involves us in an engrossing fantasy, continually challenging us to compare each situation with our own real-life experiences. The story of THE MAGIC CUP helps each of us discover that only by acting on sound moral principles can we fill our own cups with the personal and professional success and satisfaction we seek.<br></p><p>HOWARD BEHAR is a renowned business leader, author, speaker, and mentor.

Beginning in 1930 when Gaddis was at boarding-school and ending in September 1998, a few months before his death, these letters function as a kind of autobiography, and are all the more valuable because Gaddis was not an autobiographical writer. Here we see him forging his first novel <em>The Recognitions</em> (1955) while living in Mexico, fighting in a revolution in Costa Rica, and working in Spain, France, and North Africa. Over the next twenty years he struggles to find time to write the National Book Award-winning <em>J R</em> (1975) amid the complications of work and family; deals with divorce and disillusionment before reviving his career with <em>Carpenter&#x2019;s Gothic</em> (1985); then teaches himself enough about the law to indite <em>A Frolic of His Own</em> (1994), which earned him another NBA. Returning to a topic he first wrote about in the 1940s, he finishes his last novel <em>Agape Agape</em> as he lay dying.</p><p>William Gaddis (1922-98) stands among the greatest American writers of the twentieth century. The winner of two National Book Awards (for J R [1976] and A Frolic of His Own [1995]), he wrote five novels during his lifetime, including Carpenter&#x2019;s Gothic (1985), Agap&#x113; Agape (published posthumously in 2002), and his early masterpiece The Recognitions (1955). He is loved and admired for his stylistic innovations, his unforgettable characters, his pervasive humor, and the breadth of his intellect and vision.The revelation in these letters is "how chaotic the composition" of Gaddis's novels was. Gaddis let as much anxiousness and as many intrusions into the books as he could. In doing so, he captured the real chaos of our lives, boisterous and unhinged, stirred up by "the unswerving punctuality of chance," a phrase he cadged from <i>Look Homeward, Angel</i> and worked into all five of his novels. Gaddis wrote, "My own sense of all this I think comes down to this terrible search for something worth writing about, worth one's talents." For Gaddis, that search was often terrible, and his letters provide ample evidence. But the novels record his answer: These things were worth doing. &#x2014;Paul Maliszewski</p><h2>John Currin</h2><p>John Currin&#39;s paintings sit at the crossroads where Old Master painting technique and 20th-century kitsch collide.

Chapters focus on famous couples of the day and the food they shared with the rest of their thriving community. The reader roams from the staid tea of Gertrude Stein's home to the sensual overload offered by artist Man Ray and his muse, Kiki, and from the cycle races of Hemingway to the salon of Picasso, where at a joyous celebration for an aging Matisse, a donkey wanders in and eats Alice B. Toklas's hat. The meals themselves, however, retain little of their creators' flair. Surprisingly bland entries for cocoa and boiled potatoes compete with far too many recipes that call for rabbit. Additionally, the recipes are laid out in paragraphs, making the food easier to read about than to cook. But Rodriguez-Hunter ably captures the excitement and romance of the period, and her description of Langston Hughes bidding farewell to his lover over heavy cream and tiny strawberries is particularly moving. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Song of the Beast</h2><p>From Carol Berg, acclaimed author of the Rai-Kirah series, comes the epic story of Aidan MacAllister, a musician beloved by the gods, whose voice and harp could transform the souls of men...</p><p>Winner of the 2003 Colorado Book AwardThough Colorado is home, <b>Carol Berg</b>'s roots are in Texas, in a family of teachers, musicians, and railroad men.

But what were once biblical or classical commonplaces are not so readily recognizable today. This book relates in a succinct and readable way the themes, sacred and secular, on which the repertoire of Western art is based. Combined here in a single volume are religious, classical, and historical themes, figures of moral allegory, and characters from romantic poetry that appeared throughout paintings and sculpture in Western art before and after the Renaissance. More than just a dictionary, this text places these subjects in their narrative, historical, or mythological context and uses extensive cross-referencing to enhance and clarify the meanings of these themes for the reader.<br><br>The definitive work by which others are compared, this volume has become an indispensable handbook for students and general appreciators alike.

Mountbatten worked with various leaders to devise a plan for partitioning the empire into two independent sovereign states. During the remainder of his term, his daughter Pamela kept a diary recounting this remarkable time&#x2014;from trips to Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Orissa, and Assam to the exotic palaces of Indian rulers and the Rajputs in Central and Western India, and the imperial palace-cities built by the mughals. With anecdotes from her writings and a collection of atmospheric photographs, this account paints a clear picture of an extraordinary transitional period in history.</p></p><p>Pamela Mountbatten is the daughter of Earl Mountbatten of Burma, most famously known for his role in history as the last Viceroy of India. She married the designer, the late David Hicks. India Hicks is the granddaughter of Earl Mountbatten. She is the author of <i>Island Life </i>and <i>Island Beauty</i>.</p><h2>Man for Himself</h2><p>Routledge is now re-issuing this prestigious series of 204 volumes originally published between 1910 and 1965.

Unlike many men their age, they may also suffer from sleep problems, osteoporosis, and depression. Many women may even feel like they age less slowly and gracefully than their male counterparts.<br> <br> Dr. Tami Meraglia knows that the magic word here is testosterone. While there is ample discussion in the medical community about the effects of estrogen loss, few people are aware of the importance of sufficient testosterone levels in women. A healthy dosage helps women slim down, improves their mood, lowers the risk of cardiac disease, increases energy and libido, prevents osteoporosis, enhances skin tone and texture, and may even prevent cognitive decline&#x2014;yet more than 90 percent of women over age forty-five suffer from low testosterone levels. In <i>The Hormone Secret</i>, Dr. Tami offers an evidence-based thirty-day plan to restore healthy levels of testosterone and balance the relative levels of other hormones, based on lifestyle modifications such as supplements and nutritional adjustments. She also offers her Mediterranean Diet&#x2013;based meal plan and low-impact exercise ideas that will immediately boost your energy.<br> <br> With cutting-edge research and strong scientific evidence to support Dr. Tami&#x2019;s thirty-day plan, <i>The Hormone Secret</i> gives you all the information you need to balance your hormones and improve your vitality for a strong and healthy life.</p><p>Tami Meraglia, MD, known as &#x201c;Dr. Tami&#x201d; to her patients and fans, is double board certified in integrative and natural medicine and aesthetic medicine. She is the medical director of the Vitality Medical Clinic in Seattle, Washington and serves on the advisory board of Douglas Labs, one of the largest medical grade nutraceutical companies in the United States, where she contributes to research and education.The Hormone Secret CHAPTER 1<p></p> Hormones Working Together: The Entire Orchestra<p></p> <br>Perk up your ears and imagine sitting next to me as the curtain is about to rise on the opening night of a concert. The orchestra consists of strings, wind, and percussion sections, each tuning up with dissonant sounds. Initially, there is a kind of chaos as orchestra members practice and refine the parts they play in the performance that&#x2019;s about to begin. Yet slowly the instruments begin to work together in harmony. They become a cohesive unit as the curtain goes up, and the performance transports you. In many ways, your hormones, which control the functions of organs and tissues in your body, are similar to a philharmonic. Hormones must balance and work in concert with one another to create optimal health. In perimenopause or menopause, too little or too much of one hormone causes an imbalance in others and can set off a chain reaction of dysfunction. This imbalance is common, because our hormones rarely decline at exactly the same rate and pace.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s why I often hear a familiar story when a new patient comes to my office. I always ask, &#x201c;Why are you here?&#x201d; The answer is usually: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not really sick. But I don&#x2019;t have the energy I used to.&#x201d; Frequently, a primary-care physician has prescribed an antidepressant or sleeping pills. I point out that the symptoms of depression and insomnia are almost identical to those of hormone imbalance. &#x201c;First, let&#x2019;s check to see if you have any hormone deficiencies,&#x201d; I add. &#x201c;Maybe we can restore hormone balance without adding prescription drugs that have a long list of side effects.&#x201d; I want to know why my patients are experiencing a problem, and address that first, rather than to simply treat symptoms.<br> <br>I also explain that our years of perimenopause and menopause are associated with more significant physical changes than at any other time of life, except puberty. Loss of energy is only one of the issues. Unless an MD has taken additional education in integrative medicine or anti-aging (as I have), he/she can easily miss the very real problem of hormone imbalance. Why? Because the traditional medical education that I and other physicians received focuses on diseases and how to treat them, rather than on how to create and maintain wellness.<br> <br>Hormone imbalance is not a disease, but it can wreck your quality of life. We live in a society where our hormones are depleted long before the end of our life span, and at a much earlier age than was the case for our parents or grandparents. As early as our thirties, our bodies and our hormone levels are no longer in concert. The challenge is to boost some hormones to help them recalibrate and rebalance. I&#x2019;m going to educate you in how to deal with and treat any hormone deficiencies you may have. It is possible to reboot your biology with a host of nutritional and lifestyle changes, plus supplementation with herbs, vitamins, and minerals available over the counter. I help women do this every day. But first I want to help you understand the state of your own hormones.<br> What&#x2019;s Going On?<p></p> <br>Just recently, I saw three different patients who felt desperate and didn&#x2019;t know what was wrong with them. One, a single high-school English teacher, was experiencing premenstrual syndrome (PMS) for the very first time at the age of thirty-nine. She complained of cramps, headaches, and other symptoms, and she felt bewildered by this new turn of events. Another patient, forty-two years old, felt guilty about how often she kept &#x201c;losing her cool,&#x201d; after priding herself on being a patient, calm wife and mother. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t me,&#x201d; she insisted. The third woman, forty-five, a successful business executive, was experiencing profound fatigue for no plausible reason. &#x201c;I used to be a ball of energy. I don&#x2019;t understand what&#x2019;s happened to me,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>All three women had no idea their symptoms suggested the beginning of menopause. Neither they nor their primary-care physicians had made the connection, because they didn&#x2019;t have hot flashes and night sweats. Many women (and some doctors) don&#x2019;t associate exhaustion, irritability, brain fog, or unexplained weight gain and other menopausal symptoms with hormones. They conclude, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m cranky because my life is busy. I have small kids and I work. Of course I feel crappy, because I&#x2019;m not sleeping. My work is stressful. I&#x2019;m not losing weight, because I&#x2019;m not working out.&#x201d; Some of these women are divorced. Some juggle a career and the care of elderly parents. Or they&#x2019;re stay-at-home moms, contending with stresses of their own. Whatever the individual scenario, they just accept &#x201c;feeling off&#x201d; as a consequence of external grievances&#x2014;when it&#x2019;s really about internal disequilibrium that can be fixed. And the sooner the better!<br> What You Need to Know About Perimenopause and Menopause<p></p> <br>People often confuse the terms &#x201c;menopause,&#x201d; which occurs at an average age of fifty-one in North America according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and &#x201c;perimenopause,&#x201d; the years leading up to cessation of your menses. Menopause simply means you have not had a period for twelve consecutive months. Perimenopause can start ten years before you hit the mark of menopause. You may experience perimenopausal symptoms as early as your thirties&#x2014;and certainly your forties. Hot flashes and other symptoms are part of menopause, because they&#x2019;re directly related to the decline and absence of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. However, it is perimenopause that really affects your quality of life. For some women, hot flashes and night sweats start in perimenopause, the period of time when hormones begin to decline but are not yet entirely absent. Other women don&#x2019;t have flashes and sweats but do have mood, cognitive, weight, and other problems at this stage.<br> Why Is This Happening?<p></p> <br>Your ovaries are the primary organs producing several hormones, including estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone in the childbearing years. Childbearing plays a big role in hormone levels. Pregnancy is ten months, not nine. Your ovaries and adrenal glands go into a totally different modality at this time, and hormones are different. It takes quite a while for the body to figure out how to get back to normal. For example, hair gets thick and luxurious during pregnancy. You have the same static level of estrogen and progesterone while you&#x2019;re pregnant. The normal cycle of your hair growing and then falling out doesn&#x2019;t occur. It just grows and stays.<br> <br>After the baby is born, hair falls out because your hair has a lot to do with estrogen. Some women feel as if they&#x2019;re going crazy because they see handfuls of hair in the shower.<br> <br>Not everyone has lingering hormone issues after giving birth, but a large number of women do. For nearly a year, you are pregnant and your hormones are in suspended animation They don&#x2019;t go through their normal rise and fall. After pregnancy our hormones rush out, and it&#x2019;s like pulling out a plug. There&#x2019;s nothing gentle about it, and it feels very abrupt. In some women, that crash in certain hormones (particularly progesterone, which drops after you give birth, sometimes causing dreadful PMS) leads to depression. It takes the body a while to &#x201c;remember&#x201d; and kind of grease the gears to return to its cycle.<br> <br>The other problem that is common after childbirth is stress, which depletes hormones. Who is more stressed, more sleep-deprived, more exhausted than a new mom? We used to live in a village where family members, friends, and connections helped us raise a child. We don&#x2019;t live in a village anymore, and we lack the resources to restore our body systems by having somebody else hold the baby while we take a shower.<br> <br>I remember when I was in residency and had my daughter. I&#x2019;d go to the clinic early and literally lie on the floor, because I couldn&#x2019;t get up. I&#x2019;d stay there until I had to start seeing patients. I had the physical drain of different hormones needed to produce milk, the drain of lack of sleep, and the drain of &#x201c;being on call.&#x201d;<br> <br>When I first got my pager, I was so excited. Somebody was telling me that a patient was very sick, and there were all those issues to be dealt with. I turned to the nurse and said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better call a doctor.&#x201d; She said, &#x201c;You are the doctor.&#x201d; At that moment, I realized the responsibility I had stepped into in this long white coat. Throughout my residency, I never got over the stress of being on call.<br> <br>When you&#x2019;re a new mom, you&#x2019;re on call, too. It&#x2019;s: &#x201c;Is the baby going to cry while I shampoo my hair?&#x201d; or &#x201c;Will she be hungry?&#x201d; And you never relax.<br> <br>Maybe some new moms eat right, but I didn&#x2019;t. I wanted to lose the baby weight and was tired and wasn&#x2019;t cooking nutritious meals for myself. I didn&#x2019;t have to cook for the baby, who was breast-feeding. All the pillars that are the foundation for an amazing house of health&#x2014;sleep, nutrition, stress management, support, relationships, doing stuff for yourself&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t exist.<br> <br>For me, it was even harder, because my husband worked out of town at the time. He was gone for three weeks and home for one week. So I was on call 24/7. He was utterly amazing when he was home, but I missed his support for our daughter and the connection we had as a family when he was away.<br> <br>As you enter perimenopause, hormone production declines significantly in the ovaries, and the adrenal glands need to pick up the slack. When menstruation ceases and we enter menopause, the ovaries stop functioning and producing hormones altogether. Our bodies were designed to handle ovarian decline with the adrenal backup system to help maintain our quality of life. Today, however, the adrenals don&#x2019;t work well enough to produce the hormones we need. Our twenty-first-century lifestyle has created conditions that make it impossible for our adrenal glands to thrive (known as adrenal insufficiency). We&#x2019;re left with inadequate hormones to feel, look, and function at our best.<br> The Orchestra Players<p></p> <br>As you will see, testosterone is the star of the hormone symphony. But, first, let me introduce you to the supporting cast, especially estrogen and progesterone.<br> Meet Estrogen<p></p> <br>Estrogen, which is also present in men (although at a much lower level), has a big job to do for women. For example, estrogen regulates female sexual characteristics. In puberty, this hormone is responsible for the growth of curvaceous hips and full breasts. Estrogen also builds the uterine lining during the first part of a woman&#x2019;s menstrual cycle, in preparation for possible pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur, this lining is sloughed off as a period.<br> <br>Estrogen regulates the menstrual cycle, is in charge of the reproductive system, and supports a healthy sex life. The drop in estrogen during perimenopause and menopause plays havoc with your sexuality, causing loss of desire and vaginal dryness, which can lead to painful sex. Add night sweats and hot flashes, and it&#x2019;s hard to feel sexy.<br><br>Optimal Estrogen Levels<br> <br>&nbsp;Help build bone<br> <br>&nbsp;Support your sex life<br> <br>&nbsp;Help your brain<br> <br>&nbsp;Help mood and sense of well-being<br> <br>&nbsp;Affect the urinary tract, heart, and blood vessels<br> <br>&nbsp;Support skin, hair, pelvic muscles, and breasts<br> <br>&nbsp;Have been shown in studies to protect against Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease<br><br>Adequate estrogen levels are also essential for thinking and memory. Memory loss is a normal fact of life as the brain ages, but the loss is magnified when estrogen declines. A University of Rochester study published in 2013, in the journal Menopause, sheds light on the effect of menopause on cognitive functioning. Researchers followed 117 women, ages forty to sixty, in various stages of menopause and found that those who were in their first year of postmenopause experienced far greater cognitive decline and memory loss than those in perimenopause. Hormone loss was seen as the probable cause.<br> Estrogen and Surgical Menopause<p></p> <br>Surgical menopause, also known as a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) and an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries), causes an immediate jolt to women&#x2019;s lives as levels of estrogen and other hormones plummet overnight. Studies show that hysterectomy shoves women into full-blown menopause earlier, even if they retain their ovaries. Depression and sexual problems, such as low libido and vaginal dryness leading to discomfort during sex, are common.<br> <br>Cognition and memory often decline, too. The younger a woman is when she has surgical menopause, the faster cognition and memory issues develop, according to a study of eighteen hundred postmenopausal women. The findings were presented in March 2013 at the American Academy of Neurology.<br> The Estrogen Trio<p></p> <br>There are three main types of estrogen: estradiol, estrone, and estriol. They exist in different ratios depending on the stage of life you&#x2019;re in.<br> <br>Estradiol is the predominant hormone of our youth. In the childbearing years, our ovaries produce mostly estradiol (80 percent) and the rest is equally divided between estriol and estrone. As we enter menopause, the ratio changes, and we produce predominantly estrone. Each of these estrogens is broken down, primarily through the liver, into other estrogens, and each has a role to play in our health and the diseases that affect us.<br> <br>Estrone is broken down into three different components with varying functions: 2-hydroxyestrone, 4-hydroxyestrone, or 16-hydroxyestrone. The first, 2-hydroxyestrone, helps protect us from breast cancer. In contrast, 16-hydroxyestrone helps build bone, but it encourages multiplication of cells that can cause cancer. Higher than normal levels of 16-hydroxyestrone are found in women who have breast cancer. In addition, 4-hydroxyestrone has an association with cancer, too. Fortunately, you can actually guide estrone to be more protective. I&#x2019;ll show you how in future chapters.<br> <br>Estriol is produced in significant amounts only during pregnancy. The adrenal glands manufacture a little estriol, too. Estriol is a weaker estrogen compared with estradiol and estrone. Estriol, which is available over the counter, can alleviate hot flashes and vaginal dryness. I will discuss estriol&#x2019;s treatment benefits more fully in Chapter 9.<br><br>ESTROGEN SELF-TEST<br> <br>Do You Have Low Estrogen Levels?<br> <br>Major sex-hormone growth occurs during puberty and peaks at around age twenty-eight.

A South Korean soldier used his flashlight to check our emergency dispatch, then shouted back to his comrade, who in turn barked guttural phrases into a field radio.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the hangup?&#x201d; Ernie asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;They&#x2019;re worried about sabotage,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;All along the DMZ.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Us?&#x201d; Ernie asked. &#x201c;Our motives are pure.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Maybe they think we&#x2019;re Russian spies,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ernie crossed his arms. &#x201c;Tell them I don&#x2019;t even like vodka. Makes me puke.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Which designates it as unique amongst alcoholic beverages.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A convoy of M48 Patton tanks rumbled up behind us, adding a layer of urgency to the guards&#x2019; discussion. Finally, the soldier on the radio walked toward us and waved his arm. &#x201c;You go,&#x201d; he said, motioning toward the bridge.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;About time,&#x201d; Ernie grumbled. He shoved the jeep in gear and we rolled forward.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Freedom Bridge is narrow, only wide enough for one vehicle at a time, and the guards on either end of the bridge coordinate via field radio to control the flow of traffic. Armed soldiers in parkas, M16 rifles slung over their shoulders, paced the edge of the deck, studying us warily. In the muddy water below, basketball-sized chunks of ice swirled in the rapid current, smashing randomly into massive cement abutments. In the past, wooden boxes filled with explosives had been launched into the river from north of the Demilitarized Zone by our Communist brethren upriver. Sometimes the explosives floated harmlessly toward the Yellow Sea. Other times they hit something&#x2014;or someone&#x2014;and exploded, serving as a sort of North Korean forget-me-not.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My name is George Sue�o. My partner, Ernie Bascom, and I are agents for the United States Army Criminal Investigation Division in Seoul, Republic of Korea. We&#x2019;d been roused out of our bunks at oh-dark-thirty by none other than the headquarters command Staff Duty Officer. He said one word: &#x201c;Murder.&#x201d; When I stood up, fully alert, he continued, &#x201c;At the JSA. Get your butts movin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The JSA, or Joint Security Area, was also known as the truce village of Panmunjom. It was where Communist representatives of the Democratic People&#x2019;s Republic of Korea (DPRK), better known as North Korea, met with the American-allied representatives of the Republic of Korea (ROK), or South Korea. The purpose of the meetings was to make sure that war didn&#x2019;t break out again on the Korean Peninsula, as it had some twenty years ago. And that another two million people weren&#x2019;t slaughtered as a result.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When we reached the northern end of Freedom Bridge, the guards waved us on. I turned back and watched the first M48 tank in the convoy roll slowly onto the massive metal and cement edifice. On our right, we passed the US Army&#x2019;s Camp Greaves and then followed the two-lane road north through uncultivated land. It was only here, near the DMZ, that nature thrived unmolested. In the rest of South Korea, every square inch of arable land was ruthlessly cultivated, but here, near the most heavily armed border in the world, wildlife flourished. On lonely night patrols, GIs liked to kid one another that the nearly extinct Siberian tiger had made a comeback in the area. No one seriously thought it was possible. Even with their sensitive paws, the giant cats would never have been able to negotiate the acres of minefields that lurked beneath the soil on either side of the line.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I warmed my hands in front of the jeep&#x2019;s small heater. It valiantly pumped out a steady flow of hot air that dissipated quickly in the canvas-covered cab. Along the side of the road, splotches of snow and ice clung to ridges of frozen mud churned up by tracked vehicles during endless maneuvers.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A mile farther on, stanchions with signage on either side of the road warned us in English, Korean, and Chinese:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>You are about to enter the joint security area.</i><br> <i>Authorized personnel only.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With both hands gripping the top of the steering wheel, Ernie hunched forward as if expecting to fall off a cliff. &#x201c;Feels like the end of the world,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And then, by the light of a naked bulb in a wooden guard shack, we saw them. North Korean guards, doing what they did best: glare viciously at imperialist running dogs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Assholes,&#x201d; Ernie growled.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The North Koreans were outfitted in fur-lined caps, brown tunics and brown trousers, black leather belts, holstered pistols, and faces that seemed hardened into stone. One of the guards studied us through binoculars, but they didn&#x2019;t try to stop us.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;About fifty yards later, we spotted the two-story cement block building called Freedom House and beyond that the rectangular, single-story JSA conference rooms, each its own blue building. The Joint Security Area was a plot of land some 800 meters in diameter. It was accessible to designated allied and Communist soldiers under a supposed flag of truce. An American soldier used the beam of his flashlight to guide us into a parking space.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were climbing out of the jeep when he said, &#x201c;Are you CID?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We answered in the affirmative.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been waiting for you. I&#x2019;m Lieutenant Colonel Brunmeyer, Battalion Commander.&#x201d; He was tall and lanky and had the blue and white JSA patch sewn onto the left shoulder of his fatigues. He was also dressed for combat, with a camouflaged steel helmet secured by a leather strap that hugged his chin. Unconsciously, his right hand sat atop the .45 automatic strapped to his web belt.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He turned and motioned for us to follow. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s over here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As we walked, he whistled to a group of about a dozen soldiers standing on the edge of the parking area. They hoisted M16 rifles, spread out, and arrayed themselves behind us in assault formation.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lieutenant Brunmeyer spoke as we walked. &#x201c;You are to show no hesitation. When we reach the body, I want you to do your jobs as if you&#x2019;re alone and there&#x2019;s no one watching you. Any sign of weakness and the North Koreans will pounce. Be efficient, be purposeful, and be bold. Any questions?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Ernie said. &#x201c;What do you mean, &#x2018;the North Koreans will pounce&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I mean they&#x2019;ve been watching the body since it was discovered, just prior to zero four hundred. So have we. Right now, it&#x2019;s what you might call a standoff. They won&#x2019;t touch the body because we have guns pointed at them, and we won&#x2019;t touch it because they have guns pointed at us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And you want us to walk into the middle of <i>that</i>?&#x201d; Ernie asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Colonel Brunmeyer turned and studied him. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s your job, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Before Ernie could respond, I said, &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the victim?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;One of our KATUSAs,&#x201d; Brunmeyer replied. Korean Augmentation to the US Army. &#x201c;From Alpha Company. About half the men of the Joint Security Battalion are Americans, the other half KATUSAs. His name is Corporal Noh Jong-bei.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Noh Jong-bei,&#x201d; I repeated, writing it down in my notebook.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The GIs call him Johnny No-Go.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No-go,&#x201d; Ernie said. &#x201c;As in, when you don&#x2019;t pass a training requirement?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Some years ago, the US Army had adopted a &#x201c;go&#x201d; and &#x201c;no-go&#x201d; standard for military training. You were either competent in a skill&#x2014;say, firing an M16 rifle or jumping out of an airplane&#x2014;or you failed; that is, received a &#x201c;no-go.&#x201d; If you were given a &#x201c;no-go,&#x201d; you&#x2019;d be retrained until you were competent enough to earn a &#x201c;go.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Colonel Brunmeyer answered. &#x201c;But Corporal Noh wasn&#x2019;t a no-go. Nicknames are just the men&#x2019;s way of needling one another. Noh was an excellent troop.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So what happened?&#x201d; Ernie asked. &#x201c;How was he killed?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not sure. He was out here alone, we think. Late.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Was he on duty?&#x201d; I asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No. At night, we only man the observation posts.&#x201d; The towers around the perimeter of the JSA.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So what was he doing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Brunmeyer shrugged. &#x201c;No one knows.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We approached the long rectangular buildings where North Korea and South Korea actually meet. Ice crunched beneath our feet.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Four JSA guards stood at the southern edge of two parallel buildings. All wore black helmet liners with the letters &#x201c;MP&#x201d; painted in white on the front.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Colonel Brunmeyer spoke to the ranking man. &#x201c;Any movement?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No, sir. They haven&#x2019;t tried to approach the body.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Brunmeyer frowned. &#x201c;What the hell&#x2019;s wrong with them?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, sir. Usually they&#x2019;d be all over something like this. Remember when that South Korean reporter argued with one of the guards and the North Koreans took him into custody?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah, and we played hell getting him back.&#x201d; Brunmeyer placed both hands on his hips, exhaled slowly, and whispered, as if to himself: &#x201c;But for some damn reason, they&#x2019;re staying away this time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s superstition,&#x201d; the guard offered. &#x201c;They could be afraid of the dead.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Brunmeyer shook his head resolutely. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn&#x2019;t my place to say so, but I thought the North Koreans might be avoiding the victim because they didn&#x2019;t want to be blamed for his death. Whether they&#x2019;d actually committed the murder or not, they knew that being charged with such a flagrant violation of the armistice could result in war.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The guards who patrolled the Joint Security Area were armed only with pistols, per the official armistice agreement. The infantry squad that lurked in the shadows behind us, however, was armed with M16 military assault rifles. A hell of a lot more firepower. Exactly what Colonel Brunmeyer had in mind, I wasn&#x2019;t sure. He turned to his men and raised his voice so all could hear.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;These are the CID investigators from Seoul. We&#x2019;re going to give them cover while they inspect the body. Nobody fires except on my command. Is that understood?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A few mumbles were heard from the tense men.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lieutenant Colonel Brunmeyer stepped toward us. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll walk out first. Junior Lieutenant Kwon, the Night Watch Officer over there on the North Korean side, knows me. Do your jobs without hesitation. The North Koreans respect one thing and one thing only, and that&#x2019;s complete fearlessness. This Joint Security Area is open to all of us, on both sides of the MDL.&#x201d; The Military Demarcation Line. &#x201c;But during times of tension, we have a tendency to return to our own lines of scrimmage. Remember, the JSA is truce territory. We can cross the MDL if necessary.&#x201d; He pointed into the distance. &#x201c;But about fifty yards north of here is the Bridge of No Return. Don&#x2019;t go anywhere near there, because if you step onto that bridge, you&#x2019;re officially in North Korea, and heaven help you then.&#x201d; He glanced at each of us in turn. &#x201c;You ready?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Wait a minute,&#x201d; Ernie said. &#x201c;You want us to walk out to the middle of that no-man&#x2019;s-land and examine a crime scene like we&#x2019;re in the middle of a park on a summer&#x2019;s day?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Brunmeyer nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly what I want.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And if we&#x2019;re shot?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s our department.&#x201d; He paused for a moment. And then he said, &#x201c;Your death would be avenged.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ernie twisted his head to one side like a man who&#x2019;d just been sucker-punched. For once, he wasn&#x2019;t sure what to say.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;When was the last time,&#x201d; I asked, &#x201c;that you had a shooting incident here at the JSA?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Colonel Brunmeyer thought about it. &#x201c;There&#x2019;ve been plenty along the DMZ. Dozens every year. But here at the JSA, near the conference rooms? None. Fistfights, yeah, and clubbings and stabbings, a few people hurt seriously&#x2014;even disabled&#x2014;but no one&#x2019;s been killed by gunfire. Not yet. Not since the truce was signed more than twenty years ago.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I turned to Ernie and raised an eyebrow, asking without words, &#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ernie turned toward the JSA guards standing in the snow and glanced at the assault squad hovering about ten yards behind. Slowly, he twisted his head to look back at the North Koreans. Then he looked at me and grinned.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;About time we earned our pay.&#x201d; He took a step toward the JSA guards and said, &#x201c;All right, you guys, stay the hell alert. Our butts are on the line here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Brunmeyer asked, &#x201c;Ready now?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Roger Wilco,&#x201d; Ernie replied.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I hadn&#x2019;t said anything. My stomach convulsed, and if there&#x2019;d been food in it I probably would&#x2019;ve upchucked. I thought of the people I owed something to. My mother had died when I was very young, and shortly thereafter my father had disappeared into the endless mystery that is Mexico. My four-year-old son, Il-yong, was in hiding with his mother. Any move I made to be a part of his life would expose them both to danger, even death, at the hands of the Park Chunghee regime. So despite the dull ache that never left my heart, I stayed resolutely away. The woman I&#x2019;d been seeing most recently, Doctor Leah Prevault, had been transferred&#x2014;as part of a concerted effort by the army to keep us apart&#x2014;from the 121st Evacuation Hospital in Seoul to Tripler Army Medical Center in Honolulu. Despite our attempts to maintain intimacy, it was becoming increasingly clear that breathing life into a long-distance romance might be impossible.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So at that moment, the only person I owed anything to was myself.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The armed GIs were waiting. When Colonel Brunmeyer looked at me, I nodded. &#x201c;Ready, sir,&#x201d; I told him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;</p><h2>Circus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and the World Cup</h2><p>Author Andrew Zimbalist looks beyond the headlines of two of the world&#x2019;s most beloved sporting events: the Olympics and the World Cup.<br>In the expanded and updated edition of his bestselling book, <i>Circus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and the World Cup</i>, Zimbalist tackles the bogus claim that the cities chosen to host these high-profile sporting events experience an economic windfall.

She has written several books, including Women Who Wear the Breeches (published as Handsome Heroines by Anchor/Doubleday, 1996) chosen for the Independent&#39;s Best Books of 1995 list. Shahrukh has also adapted and rewritten books for film production, including Anita Desai&#39;s In Custody (Merchant Ivory Productions), which was nominated for a BAFTA award in 1994. James Mayhew has illustrated a variety of picture books for younger children, as well as many of the great classic tales and, in 1994 he received a New York Times Best Illustrated Children&#39;s Book of the Year Award for The Boy and the Cloth of Dreams. (Candlewick Press, 1994) James is a passionate opera fan and he has illustrated a number of programs for the Kirov Opera, St. Petersburg, and designed a series of T-shirts for the Metropolitan Opera Guild in New York. Miranda Richardson has many film and television credits to her name, including &#39;The Hours&#39;; &#39;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&#39;; &#39;Sleepy Hollow&#39;; &#39;Empire of the Sun&#39; and &#39;The Phantom of the Opera&#39;. Miranda has won two Golden Globe awards for her roles in &#39;Enchanted April&#39; and &#39;Fatherland&#39;.Seven operas, chosen for simplicity and relative absence of death and violence, receive lighthearted retellings, along with brief character and composer notes. The contents encompass nearly 200 years of opera history, from Gluck's 18th-century Orpheus and Eurydice, featuring an unexpectedly happy ending, to Benjamin Britten's pathos-laden The Little Sweep, with selections ranging from somber (Wagner's Flying Dutchman) to giddy (Rimski-Korsakov's Christmas Eve) in between. Husain brightens her plot summaries with flashes of humorthe usually-grim Furies respond to Orpheus's pleas by ``smiling rather rustily,'' while Gretel greets the Crunch Witch's talk of boy soup and stew with ``That's disgusting''and tucks in occasional snatches of lyric or references to singing to remind readers that opera is a musical genre. Mayhew introduces characters and catches each story's high spots with tableaux and individual portraits of gorgeously costumed figures. This is pleasant preparatory reading for a night at the opera, although it is skimpy next to The Random House Book of Opera Stories (1998, not reviewed) or other heftier guides.

Connie Braun&#x2019;s narrative continues where Sandra Birdsell&#x2019;s historical fiction <i>Russlander</i> has left off &#x2014; back to the catastrophic events of twentieth-century Europe. Braun intimately ushers us into the life of one extended Mennonite family, and in particular the life of her father and grandfather, living under the terror of Stalin, and later, under the military expansion of Hitler&#x2019;s Nazi <i>Lebensraum</i> in the Ukraine. In the vein of Janice Kulyk Keefer&#x2019;s memoir <i>Honey and Ashes: A Story of Family</i> and Anne Michaels&#x2019; <i>Fugitive Pieces</i>, Braun gives voice to the narrative of dispossession. In a memoir that is historically faithful to documents, letters, old photographs and personal testimony, Braun offers a lyrical second-generation witness to her family members and to all other Canadians who have suffered displacement in history&#x2019;s disasters, and whose obscure stories must be told. In doing so, she honours the spirit of resilience embodied by the refugees who have created and transformed Canadian society.</p></p><p><p>Connie Braun is a first generation Canadian born and raised in the Fraser Valley.

First Alphonse outgrows his jar, then the sink, and then the bathtub! This new edition of The Mysterious Tadpole boasts reimagined story twists and entirely new illustrations. The lovable giant of a tadpole has grown into something even more wonderful!</p><p>Steven Kellogg's award-winning picture book <i>The Mysterious Tadpole</i>, first published in 1977, is back with wonderful new illustrations and additional "nuances of character, sequence, and plot" in this fabulous 25th-anniversary edition. The story begins when Uncle McAllister brings a "wee bit of Scotland"--a tadpole to be precise--to Louis for his birthday. Delighted, Louis names him Alphonse and brings him to school for show-and-tell. A diet of cheeseburgers allows the creature to grow by leaps and bounds, and he soon outgrows his jar, the kitchen sink, and the bathtub. Finally, when the high school swim team learns of Alphonse's presence in their pool the hard way, Uncle McAllister gets a call: "'Oh, the wee tadpole?' he said. 'Why, he came from the lake nearby. It's the one folks call Loch Ness.'" Louis's ingenuity (he takes on a paper route to pay for his pet's burgers, and that of his friend the librarian (she thinks they can use the aquatic Alphonse to find pirate treasure and use the money to build him his own swimming pool) are heartwarming and hilarious. Children who are attached to a pet will completely relate to Louis's devotion to his unusual new friend. Kellogg's luminous illustrations of the ever-expanding monster and bewildered townspeople are expressive, often hysterical, and full of tiny details that demand many rereadings. A treat!

His 1981 abduction and murder&#x2014;unsolved for over a quarter of a century&#x2014;forever changed America.</p><p>One sunny July morning in 1981, Rev� Walsh and her six-year-old son Adam stopped by the local Sears to pick up some new lamps. Enchanted by a video game at the store's entrance, Adam begged Rev� to let him try it out while she shopped. When she returned a few minutes later, Adam was gone.</p><p>The shock of Adam's murder, and of the inability of the police and the FBI to find his killer, radically altered American innocence and our ideas about childhood. Gone forever were the days when parents would allow their kids out of the house with the casual instruction "Be home by dark!"</p><p>Rev� and John Walsh&#x2014;who would go on to create <em>America's Most Wanted</em>&#x2014;became advocates for the transformation of law enforcement's response to and handling of such cases. Prompted by the Walshes' activism, Congress passed the Missing Children Act in 1982, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was founded in 1984.</p><p>While our lives have been significantly altered by Adam Walsh's case, few of us know the whole story&#x2014;how, after more than twenty-seven years of relentless investigation, decorated Miami Beach homicide detective Joe Matthews finally identified Adam's killer.</p><p><em>Bringing Adam Home</em> is the definitive account of this horrifying crime&#x2014;which, like the Lindbergh kidnapping fifty years earlier, captured public attention&#x2014;and its aftermath, a true story of tragedy, love, faith, and dedication. It reveals the pain and tenacity of a family determined to find justice, the failed police work that allowed a killer to remain uncharged, and the determined efforts of one cop who accomplished what an entire legal system could not. As harrowing as <em>In Cold Blood</em>, yet ultimately uplifting, <em>Bringing Adam Home</em> is the riveting story of a triumph of justice and the enduring power of love.</p><p>Les Standiford is the bestselling author of twenty books and novels, including the John Deal mystery series, and the works of narrative history <em>The Man Who Invented Christmas</em> (a <em>New York Times</em> Editors&#x2019; Choice) and <em>Last Train to Paradise</em>.

But how true is this claim? In a seminal dismantling of techno-utopian visions, <i>The People's Platform</i> argues that for all that we "tweet" and "like" and "share," the Internet in fact reflects and amplifies real-world inequities at least as much as it ameliorates them. Online, just as off-line, attention and influence largely accrue to those who already have plenty of both.</p><p>What we have seen so far, Astra Taylor says, has been not a revolution but a rearrangement. Although Silicon Valley tycoons have eclipsed Hollywood moguls, a handful of giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook remain the gatekeepers. And the worst habits of the old media model&#x2015;the pressure to seek easy celebrity, to be quick and sensational above all&#x2015;have proliferated on the web, where "aggregating" the work of others is the surest way to attract eyeballs and ad revenue. When culture is "free," creative work has diminishing value and advertising fuels the system. The new order looks suspiciously like the old one. <br>We can do better, Taylor insists. The online world does offer a unique opportunity, but a democratic culture that supports diverse voices and work of lasting value will not spring up from technology alone. If we want the Internet to truly be a people's platform, we will have to make it so.</p></p><p><b>Astra Taylor</b> is a writer and documentary filmmaker.

She lives in New York City.<p>Preface</p> <p>When I was twelve years old, while most of my peers were playing outside, I hunkered down in my family&#x2019;s den, consumed by the project of making my own magazine. Obsessed with animal rights and environmentalism, I imagined my publication as a homemade corrective to corporate culture, a place where other kids could learn the truth that Saturday morning cartoons, big-budget movies, and advertisements for &#x201c;Happy Meals&#x201d; hid from them. I wrangled my friends into writing for it (I know it&#x2019;s hard to believe I had any), used desktop publishing software to design it, and was thrilled that the father of one of my conspirators managed a local Kinkos, which meant we could make copies at a steep discount. Every couple of months my parents drove me to the handful of bookstores and food co-ops in Athens, Georgia, where I eagerly asked the proprietors if I&nbsp;could give them the latest issue, convinced that when enough young people read my cri de coeur the world would change.</p> <p>It was a strange way to spend one&#x2019;s preadolescence. But equally strange, now, is to think of how much work I had to do to get it into readers&#x2019; hands once everything was written and edited. That&#x2019;s how it went back in the early nineties: each precious copy could be accounted for, either given to a friend, handed out on a street corner, shelved at a local store, or mailed to the few dozen precious subscribers I managed to amass. And I, with access to a computer, a printer, and ample professional copiers, had it pretty easy compared to those who had walked a similar road just decades before me: a veteran political organizer told me how he and his friends had to sell blood in order to raise the funds to buy a mimeograph machine so they could make a newsletter in the early sixties.</p> <p>When I was working on my magazine I had only vague inklings that the Internet even existed. Today any kid with a smartphone and a message has the potential to reach more people with the push of a button than I did during two years of self-publishing. New technologies have opened up previously unimaginable avenues for self-expression and exposure to information, and each passing year has only made it easier to spread the word.</p> <p>In many respects, my adult work as an independent filmmaker has been motivated by the same concerns as my childhood hobby: frustration with the mainstream media. So many subjects I cared about were being ignored; so many worthwhile stories went uncovered. I picked up a camera to fill in the gap, producing various documentaries focused on social justice and directing two features about philosophy. On the side I&#x2019;ve written articles and essays for the independent press, covering topics including disability rights and alternative education. When Occupy Wall Street took off in the fall of 2011, I became one of the coeditors of a movement broadsheet called the <i>Occupy! Gazette</i>, five crowd-funded issues in total, which my cohorts and I gave away for free on the Web and in print.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m a prime candidate, in other words, for cheering on the revolution that is purportedly being ushered in by the Internet. The digital transformation has been hailed as the great cultural leveler, putting the tools of creation and dissemination in everyone&#x2019;s hands and wresting control from long-established institutions and actors. Due to its remarkable architecture, the Internet facilitates creativity and communication in unprecedented ways. Each of us is now our own broadcaster; we are no longer passive consumers but active producers. Unlike the one-way, top-down transmission of radio or television and even records and books, we finally have a medium through which everyone&#x2019;s voice can supposedly be heard.</p> <p>To all of this I shout an enthusiastic hurrah. Progressives like myself have spent decades decrying mass culture and denouncing big media. Since 1944, when Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno published their influential essay &#x201c;The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception,&#x201d; critics have sounded the alarm about powerful corporate interests distorting our culture and drowning out democracy in pursuit of profit.</p> <p>But while heirs to this tradition continue to worry about commercialism and media consolidation, there is now a countervailing tendency to assume that the Internet, by revolutionizing our media system, has rendered such concerns moot. In a digital world, the number of channels is theoretically infinite, and no one can tell anyone what to consume. We are the ultimate deciders, fully in charge of our media destinies, choosing what to look at, actively seeking and clicking instead of having our consumption foisted upon us by a cabal of corporate executives.</p> <p>As a consequence of the Internet, it is assumed that traditional gatekeepers will crumble and middlemen will wither. The new orthodoxy envisions the Web as a kind of Robin Hood, stealing audience and influence away from the big and giving to the small. Networked technologies will put professionals and amateurs on an even playing field, or even give the latter an advantage. Artists and writers will thrive without institutional backing, able to reach their audiences directly. A golden age of sharing and collaboration will be ushered in, modeled on Wikipedia and open source software.</p> <p>In many wonderful ways this is the world we have been waiting for. So what&#x2019;s the catch? In some crucial respects the standard assumptions about the Internet&#x2019;s inevitable effects have misled us. New technologies have undoubtedly removed barriers to entry, yet, as I will show, cultural democracy remains elusive. While it&#x2019;s true that anyone with an Internet connection can speak online, that doesn&#x2019;t mean our megaphones blast our messages at the same volume. Online, some speak louder than others. There are the followed and the followers. As should be obvious to anyone with an e-mail account, the Internet, though open to all, is hardly an egalitarian or noncommercial paradise, even if you bracket all the porn and shopping sites.</p> <p>To understand why the most idealistic predictions about how the Internet would transform cultural production and distribution, upending the balance of power in the process, have not come to pass, we need to look critically at the current state of our media system. Instead, we celebrate a rosy vision of what our new, networked tools theoretically make possible or the changes they will hypothetically unleash. What&#x2019;s more, we need to look ahead and recognize the forces that are shaping the development and implementation of technology&#x2014;economic forces in particular.</p> <p><br>Writing critically about technological and cultural transformation means proceeding with caution. Writers often fall into one of two camps, the cheerleaders of progress at any cost and the prophets of doom who condemn change, lamenting all they imagine will be lost. This pattern long precedes us. In 1829, around the time advances in locomotion and telegraphy inspired a generation to speak rapturously of the &#x201c;annihilation of space and time,&#x201d; Thomas Carlyle, the Victorian era&#x2019;s most irascible and esteemed man of letters, published a sweeping indictment of what he called the Mechanical Age.</p> <p>Everywhere Carlyle saw new contraptions replacing time-honored techniques&#x2014;there were machines to drive humans to work faster or replace them altogether&#x2014;and he was indignant: &#x201c;We war with rude Nature; and, by our resistless engines, come off always victorious, and loaded with spoils.&#x201d; Yet the spoils of this war, he anxiously observed, were not evenly distributed. While some raced to the top, others ate dust. Wealth had &#x201c;gathered itself more and more into masses, strangely altering the old relations, and increasing the distance between the rich and the poor.&#x201d; More worrisome still, mechanism was encroaching on the inner self. &#x201c;Not the external and physical alone is now managed by machinery, but the internal and spiritual also,&#x201d; he warned. &#x201c;Men are grown mechanical in head and in heart, as well as in hand,&#x201d; a shift he imagined would make us not wiser but worse off.</p> <p>Two years later, Timothy Walker, a young American with a career in law ahead of him, wrote a vigorous rebuttal entitled &#x201c;Defense of Mechanical Philosophy.&#x201d; Where Carlyle feared the mechanical metaphor making society over in its image, Walker welcomed such a shift, dismissing Carlyle as a vaporizing mystic. Mechanism, in Walker&#x2019;s judgment, has caused no injury, only advantage. Where mountains stood obstructing, mechanism flattened them. Where the ocean divided, mechanism stepped across. &#x201c;The horse is to be unharnessed, because he is too slow; and the ox is to be unyoked, because he is too weak. Machines are to perform the drudgery of man, while he is to look on in self-complacent ease.&#x201d; Where, Walker asked, is the wrong in any of this?</p> <p>Carlyle, Walker observed, feared &#x201c;that mind will become subjected to the laws of matter; that physical science will be built up on the ruins of our spiritual nature; that in our rage for machinery, we shall ourselves become machines.&#x201d; On the contrary, Walker argued, machines would free our minds by freeing our bodies from tedious labor, thus permitting all of humankind to become &#x201c;philosophers, poets, and votaries of art.&#x201d; That &#x201c;large numbers&#x201d; of people had been thrown out of work as a consequence of technological change is but a &#x201c;temporary inconvenience,&#x201d; Walker assured his readers&#x2014;a mere misstep on mechanism&#x2019;s &#x201c;triumphant march.&#x201d;</p> <p>Today, most pronouncements concerning the impact of technology on our culture, democracy, and work resound with Carlyle&#x2019;s and Walker&#x2019;s sentiments, their well-articulated insights worn down into twenty-first-century sound bites. The argument about the impact of the Internet is relentlessly binary, techno-optimists facing off against techno-skeptics. Will the digital transformation liberate humanity or tether us with virtual chains? Do communicative technologies fire our imaginations or dull our senses? Do social media nurture community or intensify our isolation, expand our intellectual faculties or wither our capacity for reflection, make us better citizens or more efficient consumers? Have we become a nation of skimmers, staying in the shallows of incessant stimulation, or are we evolving into expert synthesizers and multitaskers, smarter than ever before? Are those who lose their jobs due to technological change deserving of our sympathy or our scorn (&#x201c;adapt or die,&#x201d; as the saying goes)? Is that utopia on the horizon or dystopia around the bend?</p> <p>These questions are important, but the way they are framed tends to make technology too central, granting agency to tools while sidestepping the thorny issue of the larger social structures in which we and our technologies are embedded. The current obsession with the neurological repercussions of technology&#x2014;what the Internet is doing to our brains, our supposedly shrinking attention spans, whether video games improve coordination and reflexes, how constant communication may be addictive, whether Google is making us stupid&#x2014;is a prime example. This focus ignores the business imperatives that accelerate media consumption and the market forces that encourage compulsive online engagement.</p> <p>Yet there is one point on which the cheerleaders and the naysayers agree: we are living at a time of profound rupture&#x2014;something utterly unprecedented and incomparable. All connections to the past have been rent asunder by the power of the network, the proliferation of smartphones, tablets, and Google glasses, the rise of big data, and the dawning of digital abundance. Social media and memes will remake reality&#x2014;for better or for worse. My view, on the other hand, is that there is as much continuity as change in our new world, for good and for ill.</p> <p>Many of the problems that plagued our media system before the Internet was widely adopted have carried over into the digital domain&#x2014;consolidation, centralization, and commercialism&#x2014;and will continue to shape it. Networked technologies do not resolve the contradictions between art and commerce, but rather make commercialism less visible and more pervasive. The Internet does not close the distance between hits and flops, stars and the rest of us, but rather magnifies the gap, eroding the middle space between the very popular and virtually unknown. And there is no guarantee that the lucky few who find success in the winner-take-all economy online are more diverse, authentic, or compelling than those who succeeded under the old system.</p> <p>Despite the exciting opportunities the Internet offers, we are witnessing not a leveling of the cultural playing field, but a rearrangement, with new winners and losers. In the place of Hollywood moguls, for example, we now have Silicon Valley tycoons (or, more precisely, we have Hollywood moguls <i>and</i> Silicon Valley tycoons). The pressure to be quick, to appeal to the broadest possible public, to be sensational, to seek easy celebrity, to be attractive to corporate sponsors&#x2014;these forces multiply online where every click can be measured, every piece of data mined, every view marketed against. Originality and depth eat away at profits online, where faster fortunes are made by aggregating work done by others, attracting eyeballs and ad revenue as a result.</p> <p>Indeed, the advertising industry is flourishing as never before. In a world where creative work holds diminishing value, where culture is &#x201c;free,&#x201d; and where fields like journalism are in crisis, advertising dollars provide the unacknowledged lifeblood of the digital economy. Moreover, the constant upgrading of devices, operating systems, and Web sites; the move toward &#x201c;walled gardens&#x201d; and cloud computing; the creep of algorithms and automation into every corner of our lives; the trend toward filtering and personalization; the lack of diversity; the privacy violations: all these developments are driven largely by commercial incentives. Corporate power and the quest for profit are as fundamental to new media as old. From a certain angle, the emerging order looks suspiciously like the old one.</p> <p>In fact, the phrase &#x201c;new media&#x201d; is something of a misnomer because it implies that the old media are on their way out, as though at the final stage of some natural, evolutionary process. Contrary to all the talk of dinosaurs, this is more a period of adaptation than extinction. Instead of distinct old and new media, what we have is a complex cultural ecosystem that spans the analog and digital, encompassing physical places and online spaces, material objects and digital copies, fleshy bodies and virtual identities.</p> <p>In that ecosystem, the online and off-line are not discrete realms, contrary to a perspective that has suffused writing about the Internet since the word &#x201c;cyberspace&#x201d; was in vogue.1 You might be reading this book off a page or screen&#x2014;a screen that is part of a gadget made of plastic and metal and silicon, the existence of which puts a wrench into any fantasy of a purely ethereal exchange. All bits eventually butt up against atoms; even information must be carried along by something, by stuff.</p> <p>I am not trying to deny the transformative nature of the Internet, but rather to recognize that we&#x2019;ve lived with it long enough to ask tough questions.2 Thankfully, this is already beginning to happen. Over the course of writing this book, the public conversation about the Internet and the technology industry has shifted significantly.3 There have been revelations about the existence of a sprawling international surveillance infrastructure, uncompetitive business and exploitative labor practices, and shady political lobbying initiatives, all of which have made major technology firms the subjects of increasing scrutiny from academics, commentators, activists, and even government officials in the United States and abroad.4</p> <p>People are beginni...</p></p><h2>DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS (1ST PRT)</h2><p>&#34;Contains storybook classics The Reluctant Dragon (Kenneth Grahame) and The Book of Beasts (E.

Whether writing on the many aspects of evolution or on science in general - the importance of science, the poetry of science, the fact that science is inspiring (or ought to be) - he is often provocative, sometimes outrageous, never less than highly influential.</p></p><p>Richard Dawkins has an opinion on everything biological, it seems, and in <i>A Devil's Chaplain</i>, everything is biological. Dawkins weighs in on topics as diverse as ape rights, jury trials, religion, and education, all examined through the lens of natural selection and evolution. Although many of these essays have been published elsewhere, this book is something of a greatest-hits compilation, reprinting many of Dawkins' most famous recent compositions. They are well worth re-reading. His 1998 review of Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont's <i>Fashionable Nonsense</i> is as bracing an indictment of academic obscurantism as the book it covered, although the review reveals some of Dawkins' personal biases as well. Several essays are devoted to skillfully debunking religion and mysticism, and these are likely to raise the hackles of even casual believers. Science, and more specifically evolutionary science, underlies each essay, giving readers a glimpse into the last several years' debates about the minutiae of natural selection. In one moving piece, Dawkins reflects on his late rival Stephen Jay Gould's <i>magnum opus</i>, <i>The Structure of Evolutionary Theory</i>, and clarifies what it was the two Darwinist heavyweights actually disagreed about. While the collection showcases Dawkins' brilliance and intellectual sparkle, it brings up as many questions as it answers. As an ever-ardent champion of science, honest discourse, and rational debate, Dawkins will obviously relish the challenge of answering them. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist renowned throughout the world.

Kennedy. At the heart of the plots is the mysterious Lee Harvey Oswald, who quickly wins Judyth's affection and love. In this true-life story, Judyth offers documentation on page after page: how she came to be a cancer expert at such a young age, how her relocation to New Orleans was engineered to involve her in the get-Castro plot, how she was manipulated to help develop a biological weapon to eliminate Castro, and how Oswald came to confide in her. Judyth's narrative connects the dots to heretofore shadowy and hidden events in New Orleans and Dallas involving Oswald. She reveals how Oswald, ordered to hand off the biological weapon to a contact in Mexico City, found himself betrayed there. His eyes now opened, the future Patsy went on to sacrifice his life through his efforts to save Kennedy, as well as to protect those he loved from certain death. Judyth, who knew of Kennedy's impending assassination through conversations with Oswald occurring less than two days before Kennedy was shot in Dealey Plaza, confirms that Oswald was a deep-cover intelligence agent who was framed for an assassination he was actually trying to prevent.

Rare and original texts, heart-stopping photography, and decades of gossip and anecdotes take you from film to rock and roll, from scandals to masterpieces, from starlets to moguls, and studios to bungalows in an unprecedented tour of Hollywood from the Golden Age to this morning&#39;s wake-up call.</p><p>The subhead for this sleazy and rather dull pseudo-expose of Hollywood scandal should probably be Style Slaughters Substance. The ugly, tabloid-sendup layout not only makes the book difficult to read but degrades the little bit of quality it contains. Editor Balazs, who owns the Chateau Marmont Hotel (famous as the place where several celebrities checked in in order to check out), had the taste to choose a very funny selection from Lillian Ross's Picture and the chilling William Faulkner short story "Golden Land" but wastes too much space on the tedious excesses of the druggy 1960s. The surprisingly conservative recounting of the "Top Ten Hollywood Scandals" breaks no new ground. If Balazs's intention was to pique interest in the Chateau Marmont, that venerable survivor comes out sounding like a place with tatty carpets and pleated lampshades, where the sad and desperate go to end their lives.

This important new book introduces a system that will allow women to regulate their menstrual cycles and take control over their bodies and their lives. Jeanne Blum, a holistic healer, shows you how to locate the 24 Forbidden Pregnancy Points, how to massage them, and recommends methods for working them to unblock energy and maintain optimum health.</p><p>Blum's intriguing book unveils a mystery of traditional Chinese medicine--the uses of the so-called forbidden pregnancy points. Weaving together personal anecdote, historical reflection, theory, and praxis, Blum describes how she first learned of the 24 forbidden points while training to be an acupuncturist. No one could tell her anything about the points except that they should be avoided during pregnancy. Blum asked the obvious question, What effect might there be on a woman during the first weeks of pregnancy if, unaware of her condition, she was unable to inform a therapist to avoid them? Using herself as prime guinea pig, Blum experimentally ascertained the healing uses of the points, which are indeed powerful enough to disrupt pregnancy but hold as powerful a potential for healing both emotional and physical traumas. An excellent addition for collections where interest in alternative medicine is high. <i>Patricia Monaghan</i></p><h2>Parkinson&#39;s Law, and Other Studies in Administration</h2><p>Documents ten case studies that explore aspects of business organization ranging from staff accumulation to cocktail party behavior</p><p></p><h2>The Copper Crown: A Novel of the Keltiad</h2><p>In the twenty-fourth century, a scout ship from Earth discovers the ancient Keltic empire and, amid treachery, magic, and intrigue, could tip the balance in a power struggle of galactic dimensions</p><p><i>The Copper Crown</i> is a rich and magical book, as deep and generous as the best in human nature.

If Miss Marple were fat and jolly and lived in Botswana--and decided to go against any conventional notion of what an unmarried woman should do, spending the money she got from selling her late father's cattle to set up a Ladies' Detective Agency--then you have an idea of how Precious sets herself up as her country's first female detective. Once the clients start showing up on her doorstep, Precious enjoys a pleasingly successful series of cases. </p> <p> But the edge of the Kalahari is not St. Mary Mead, and the sign Precious orders, painted in brilliant colors, is anything but discreet. Pointing in the direction of the small building she had purchased to house her new business, it reads "THE NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY. FOR ALL CONFIDENTIAL MATTERS AND ENQUIRIES. SATISFACTION GUARANTEED FOR ALL PARTIES. UNDER PERSONAL MANAGEMENT." </p> <p> The solutions she comes up with, whether in the case of the clinic doctor with two quite different personalities (depending on the day of the week), or the man who had joined a Christian sect and seemingly vanished, or the kidnapped boy whose bones may or may not be those in a witch doctor's magic kit, are all sensible, logical, and satisfying. Smith's gently ironic tone is full of good humor towards his lively, intelligent heroine and towards her fellow Africans, who live their lives with dignity and with cautious acceptance of the confusions to which the world submits them. Precious Ramotswe is a remarkable creation, and <i>The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency</i> well deserves the praise it received from London's <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>.

Cover art by Doug Beekman.</p><p>Del Rey's Impact line introduces a list of titles that have "slipped through the cracks and become buried treasure." The re-release of Tim Powers's <i>The Drawing of the Dark</i> (first published in 1979) is indeed worthy of the imprint. It was his third novel and first foray into the fantasy genre.<p> It is the year 1529 and Brian Duffy, a soldier of fortune, finds himself in Venice. A late-night confrontation with three brothers over a matter of honor convinces Brian to find greener pastures. After a chance meeting with an old monk named Aurelainus, Brian finds himself hired on to be the bouncer at the famous Herzwesten brewery and inn (formerly a monastery) located in Vienna. During Brian's voyage from Venice to Vienna, he crosses the Dolomite Mountains, only to meet assassins who attack him. Dwarves and creatures Brian knew only from mythology assist him in vanquishing his attackers.</p><p> The mythical Fisher King is a central character in <i>The Drawing of the Dark</i>, and cameos by the Roman god Bacchus, the Lady of the Lake, reincarnations of King Arthur and Sigmund from Norse mythology, Merlin, and hosts of soldiers, including Vikings and Swiss mercenaries, add to the otherworldly feel. The legendary heroes are allied against legions of soldiers from the Turkish Ottoman Empire under Suleiman and his wizard Ibrahim, who try to repeat the successes of their 1521 and 1526 invasions of eastern Europe by laying siege to Vienna. But just what is their objective? The city or the beer?</p><p> Tim Powers does a great job of tying the historical invasion of eastern Europe by the Turks to a rollicking, fun-filled fantasy, which offers its own reasons for the invasion and a wonderful cast of heroes that ultimately repel the invaders. This is a must-read for Tim Powers fans and for readers who have yet to delve into his rich, wonderful worlds. <i>--Robert Gately</i></p><br>"The Drawing of the Dark is not only one of my favorite Tim Powers novels, it's simply one of my favorite novels.

BLAYLOCK<br><br>"Tim Powers does it right! Combining the best of mythology and real history, he takes you on a rollicking magical adventure that is both tense and hilarious.

So raise your glass to The Drawing of the Dark."<br>--DAVID BRIN<br><br>"I stand in awe of Tim Powers's recent work, but I must confess my secret love for The Drawing of the Dark. Powers was one of the first to put fantasy back in the city where it belongs! If you're sick of endless quests through murky woods and lonely mountains, this is the place to start."<br>--ELLEN KUSHNER<br> Author of Swordspoint<br><br>"Tim Powers is like no other.

Every twig on the maples and giant sycamores was sheathed in white. Far out in the trees, owls watched him with their feathers fluffed out for warmth, their eyes shining. <br>Deep cold was a quiet monster. It slithered into clothing, stiffened leather, and afflicted bones with agony. Its unnaturally silent voice made ears crave even the slightest sound. The sheer vastness of the frozen land pressed down upon him tonight. <br> <i>What is my offering? What can I give him to help him?</i> <br>When he crested the hill and gazed out across the valley where hundreds of campfires glittered, he took a few moments to contemplate the next few days. He suspected they would be some of the most difficult of his existence. <br>He inhaled a deep breath, and started down the hill toward the warriors who had waged the battle. Frozen flowers hid amid the shriveled leaves on the sides of the trail, dead, folded in upon themselves. <br>As he neared Yellowtail Village, smoke flowed upward from the charred longhouses and obliterated the glittering Path of Souls that painted a white swath across the night sky. His People, the People of the Hills, believed that each person had two souls. One remained with the bones forever. The other, the afterlife soul, stayed on earth for ten days. Then, if it were lucky enough to be properly prepared, it followed the Path of Souls to a long bridge that spanned a dark abyss. On this side of the bridge were all the animals a person had ever known in his life. The animals who had loved him helped him across. Those that he had mistreated chased him, trying to force him to fall off the bridge into eternal darkness. If his animal helpers were strong enough and he made it to the other side, he would be greeted by his ancestors in the Land of the Dead. <br>Some people, however, had trouble finding the Path of Souls. Especially those who died violently. <br>His eyes narrowed. On the battlefield below, dead bodies lay contorting as they froze. There must be thousands of glistening soul lights, lost souls, out there bobbing and swaying in confusion, searching for loved ones to take care of them. If Sonon closed his eyes, he could hear their spectral cries rising. <br>He folded his arms beneath his cape, trying to stay warm while he continued thinking. <br> <i>Yes, maybe&nbsp;&#x2026; </i> <br>Perhaps the single greatest truth of life was that the dead were not dead. Their shadows lived. They wandered the forests, slept in crackling fires and ancient sycamores, they huddled in grass that wept and stones that whimpered. They were the painted prayersticks that Great Grandmother Earth used to dance life in and out of this world. If humans could only learn to watch shadows pass like a mountain did, they would understand that death was just a whisper. <br>&#x201c;Is that my offering?&#x201d; <br>War songs lilted through the sparkling air, mixing eerily with the sobs and moans coming from the destroyed villages. <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said softly, deciding. &#x201c;A glimpse from inside the mountain.&#x201d; <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2012 by Kathleen O&#x2019;Neal Gear and W.

This paperback edition of Walter Lippmann's classic work includes a revised introduction by William E. Leuchtenburg that places the book in its historical and political contexts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his first book, <i>A Preface to Politics,</i> Lippmann was sharply critical of traditionalism in favor of creativity&#x2014;so much so that he was accused of anti-intellectualism. In Drift and Mastery, he corrected this imbalance, exploring the tensions between expansion and consolidation, traditionalism an progressivism, emotion and rationality. He wrote to convince readers that they could balance these tensions: they could be organized, efficient, and functional without sacrificing impulse, choice, fantasy, or liberty. Mastery is attainable, Lippmann argued, but scientific endeavor is driven by human curiosity and creativity&#x2014;an argument in favor of science as both a method as both a method for discovering the truth and a means of wish fulfillment through diligent attention to facts.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drift and Mastery</i> is both a telling product of its times and a lucid exploration of timeless themes in American government and politics.

Things weren't really what they seemed. They never had been. That was the problem -- why she'd promised herself she wouldn't come back here.</p><p> The yellow light gleaming in an upstairs bedroom winked out. Clay was going to bed, probably at the same time as he did every night. Grace couldn't understand how he could live alone out here. How he could eat, sleep and work the farm -- only forty paces away from where they'd hidden their stepfather's body.</p><p> The warning chime signaling that she'd left her keys in the ignition sounded as she got out of her small BMW. She hadn't planned to venture onto the property. But now that she was here, she had to see for herself that even after so many years there was nothing to give them away.</p><p> Her cotton skirt swayed gently against her calves as she walked down the long drive. There was no wind, no sound except the cicadas and frogs, and the crunch of her sandals on gravel. If she'd forgotten anything, it was the quiet in this part of the state and how brightly the stars could shine away from the city.</p><p> She pictured herself as a young girl, sleeping on the front lawn with her younger sister, Molly, and her older stepsister, Madeline. Those were special times, when they'd talked and laughed and gazed up at the black velvet sky to find all those twinkling stars staring right back at them like a silent promise of good things to come. They'd all been so innocent then. When Madeline was around, Grace had had nothing to fear. But Madeline couldn't stick by Grace's side every minute. She hadn't even realized she should. She still didn't know what it was like for Grace back then. She'd been at a friend's house the night everything went wrong.</p><p> Despite the humidity, Grace shivered as she came upon the barn. Set off to the right, it lurked among the weeping willows and poplars. She hated everything associated with the old building. It was there she'd cleaned out the stall of the horse her stepfather wouldn't let anyone but him ride. It was there she'd gathered the eggs and fought with the mean rooster who used to fly at her in an attempt to gouge out her eyes. It was there, in the front corner of the building, that the reverend had kept a small office where he retired to write his Sunday sermons -- and to delve into that locked file drawer.</p><p> The smell of moist earth and magnolias brought it all back too vividly, causing her to break out in a cold sweat. Curving her fingernails into her palms to remind herself that she was no longer a powerless girl, she immediately steered her thoughts away from the reverend's office. She'd promised herself she'd forget.</p><p> But she certainly hadn't forgotten yet. Despite her best efforts, she couldn't help wondering if that stifling room was still untouched. Except for what the reverend had kept in his file drawer, the office had been left intact, as if he might someday reappear and want to use it. Her mother had insisted they'd be foolish to change anything. She'd drilled it into all of them, except Madeline of course, that they must continue to refer to the reverend in the present tense. Folks in town were already suspicious enough.</p><p> Stillwater's residents had long memories, but eighteen years had passed since the reverend's sudden disappearance. Surely after so much time Clay could dismantle that damn office....</p><p> A deep voice came suddenly out of the dark. "Get the hell off my property or I'll shoot."</p><p> Grace whirled to see a man at least six foot four inches tall, so solidly built he could have been made of stone, standing only a few feet away. It was her brother, and he had a rifle trained on her.</p><p> For the briefest of moments, Grace wished he'd shoot.</p><p> But then she laughed. Clay was as vigilant as ever. Not that she was really surprised. He'd always been The Guardian.</p><p> "What?Ya'll don't know your own sister anymore?" she said and stepped out of the building's shadow.</p><p> "Grace?" The barrel of the hunting rifle dove toward the ground and he twitched as though tempted to gather her in a hug. Grace felt a similar response, but made no move toward him. Their relationship was too...complicated. "God, Grace. It's been thirteen years since you left. I barely recognize you. You could've gotten yourself shot," he added gruffly.</p><p> She said nothing about that brief cowardly impulse: <i>One bullet could end it all.</i></p><p> "Really?" she murmured. "I would've recognized you anywhere." Maybe it was because she thought of him so often. Besides, he hadn't changed much. He still had the same thick black hair -- even darker than Grace's -- that swirled up off his forehead. The light, enigmatic eyes that looked so much like her own. That same determined set to his prominent jaw. He'd put on a few more pounds of muscle mass, maybe, which made her feel small at five-five and a hundred and twenty pounds. But his bulkier size was the only difference.</p><p> "I expected you to be asleep," she said.</p><p> "Saw your car pull up out front."</p><p> "Wouldn't want to let just anyone go creeping around out here."</p><p> If he heard the taunt in her voice, he didn't respond to it. Except to glance furtively toward the copse of trees that served as a marker for their stepfather's grave.</p><p> After a stilted silence, he said, "Living in Jackson must agree with you. You look good."</p><p> She'd been doing quite well in the city. Until George E. Dunagan, Attorney-at-Law, had asked her to marry him. When, for the third time, she couldn't say yes, even though they both knew she wanted to, he'd finally broken off the relationship. He'd told her he didn't want to hear from her until she'd seen a therapist and resolved the issues of her childhood.</p><p> She'd tried visiting a therapist -- but counseling hadn't helped. There were too many realities she didn't want to examine. Others she <i>wanted</i> to share but couldn't, not with a therapist or anyone else, including George. Although George had recently relented and started calling her again, Grace's problems still stood between them.</p><p> She hoped that wouldn't be true for much longer. Either she'd overcome the past or the past would overcome her. She couldn't know how it would all end. She could only promise herself that she wouldn't return to her life in Jackson until she'd come to terms with what had happened in Stillwater.</p><p> "I keep busy," she said.</p><p> "Mom tells me you graduated first in your class at Georgetown."</p><p> Six years ago... She gave him an indifferent smile. He sounded impressed. But what she achieved never satisfied her for long. "Amazing what you can do when you apply yourself, huh?"</p><p> "How'd you get into a school like that?" She'd left town two days after graduating from Still-water High, worked as a waitress at a greasy spoon in Jackson in order to scrape by, and spent every available minute -- for two years -- studying for the entrance exams. When she wound up with an almost perfect score, no one seemed to care too much about her high school GPA. She managed to get into the University of Iowa, and after that she'd been accepted at Georgetown.</p><p> But she didn't see any point in discussing the details with Clay. She didn't look back on her college days, when she'd slept only three or four hours a night, with any pride or nostalgia. While everyone else juggled school<i> and</i> a normal social life, she'd kept to herself and tolerated nothing less than academic excellence.</p><p> She'd been trying to make up for the past, trying to prove that she was more than everyone thought. But after graduating from law school and working as an assistant district attorney for the past five years, she'd finally realized that running away wasn't the solution. She <i>still</i> couldn't move on with her personal life.</p><p> "I got lucky," she said simply.</p><p> He glanced at the house. "Wanna come in?" Hearing the hope in those words, she studied the deep porch where they used to sit on the steps and listen to their mother read scripture. The reverend had demanded they study the Bible for an hour each day. But it hadn't been a bad experience. Holding a glass of lemonade, Grace would feel the oppressive heat of a summer's day cool slightly as evening approached. She'd hear the lilt of her mother's voice as the boards beneath the old rocking chair creaked and the lightning bugs danced near the porch light. She'd always enjoyed it -- until the reverend came home.</p><p> "No, I -- I'd better be going." She started edging away. Seeing Clay, knowing he was still on guard, was enough. She couldn't face any more memories tonight.</p><p> "How long will you be in town?"</p><p> She paused when he spoke. "I don't know."</p><p> He scowled, and she thought he looked rather harsh for such a handsome man. Evidently, carrying the family's dark secret was taking its toll on him, too. "What brings you back after all this time?" he asked.</p><p> She narrowed her eyes in challenge. "Sometimes I feel like doing the right thing and telling everyone what happened here."</p><p> "How do you know it's the right thing?" he asked softly.</p><p> "Because I've spent the past five years championing the truth and making people take responsibility for their actions."</p><p> "Are you sure you always get the right guy, Grace? And that he gets the appropriate punishment?"</p><p> "We have to trust the system, Clay. Without it, our whole society falls apart."</p><p> "Who deserves to pay for what happened here?" The man who was buried in the ground. But Clay already knew that, so she didn't respond.</p><p> "Why haven't you come forward before?" he asked.</p><p> "For the same reason you're still guarding this place with that gun," she admitted.</p><p> He studied her for several seconds. "Sounds like you have a tough decision to make."</p><p> "I guess I do."</p><p> No response.</p><p> "Aren't you going to try and talk me out of it?" she asked with a bitter laugh.</p><p> "Sorry," he said. ...</p></p><h2>Inventing Montana: Dispatches from the Madison Valley</h2><p>Every summer for two decades, Ted Leeson and a maverick group of close companions have returned to an old ranch house on the benchland overlooking the Madison River. Trout and fly fishing may be at the heart of their ritual return, but their experience goes far beyond the fishing. Leeson contemplates both the human and natural landscape brilliantly: the fly-anglers&#x2019; passionate, ironic, and sometimes hilarious allegiances to what they do; the intriguing Madison Valley and its creatures and flowers; the trout town of Ennis; maps and their revelations; the green-card&#x201d; experience of living in a place in which you are not native; the nature of leisure. &nbsp;<br><br> Full of wit, surprise, shrewd observation, and wisdom, this book tells a story about creating a place of temporary liberty, and inhabiting a world fashioned of your best imaginings, where you might, for a time, live the potencies of a place that you have shaped and has shaped you. No lover of the very best writing about fly fishing and the natural world can afford to miss this stunning book.</p><p><strong>Ted Leeson</strong> is the author or editor of nearly a dozen books, including the highly praised <em>The Habit of Rivers</em> and <em>Jerusalem Creek</em>.

In <i>The Rise Of Enlightened Sexism</i>, Susan J. Douglas, one of America's most entertaining and insightful cultural critics, takes readers on a spirited journey through the television programs, popular songs, movies, and news coverage of recent years, telling a story that is nothing less than the cultural biography of a new generation of American women.</p><p>Revisiting cultural touchstones from <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> to <i>Survivor</i> to <i>Desperate Housewives</i>, Douglas uses wit and wisdom to expose these images of women as mere fantasies of female power, assuring women and girls that the battle for equality has been won, so there's nothing wrong with resurrecting sexist stereotypes&#x2015;all in good fun, of course. She shows that these portrayals not only distract us from the real-world challenges facing women today but also drive a wedge between baby-boom women and their "millennial" daughters.</p><p>In seeking to bridge this generation gap, Douglas makes the case for casting aside these retrograde messages, showing us how to decode the mixed messages that restrict the ambitions of women of all ages. And what makes <i>The Rise Of Enlightened Sexism</i> such a pleasure to read is Douglas's unique voice, as she blends humor with insight and offers an empathetic and sisterly guide to the images so many American women love and hate with equal measure.</p></p><p><p><b>Susan J.

Law</i>, <i>America&#x2019;s Funniest Home Videos</i>, and the buildup to Operation Desert Storm on CNN, the still fledging Fox network debuted a show on Thursday nights opposite <i>Cheers</i>, the top-rated program in the country. In December the new show was ranked eighty-seventh out of eighty-nine. The reviews were not kind either. A &#x201c;new experiment in comatose television,&#x201d; was the verdict of Tom Shales at the <i>Washington Post</i>: &#x201c;You keep checking your pulse to make sure you haven&#x2019;t died.&#x201d;1 Matt Roush in <i>USA Today</i> used words like &#x201c;tired&#x201d; and &#x201c;stock characters&#x201d; and predicted &#x201c;few will leave <i>Cheers</i> for this.&#x201d;2 Jay Sharbutt of the Associated Press said the premiere &#x201c;is so stultifying it would get an F even in film school.&#x201d;3 Ouch.<br>None of these guys, however, was a teenage girl. Within six months, <i>Beverly Hills 90210</i> was the top show among teenagers in the Thursday 9:00 P.M. time slot, and 60 percent of them were girls, that delectable demographic. Instead of running reruns during the summer of 1991, Fox aired new episodes, which built the audience even more. In August, heartthrob Luke Perry&#x2014;deliberately modeled after James Dean right down to his pompadoured hairdo (which presided over his forehead like Diamond Head)&#x2014;visited a Florida shopping mall to promote the show. Ten thousand fans, most of them screaming girls, rushed toward him, injuring twenty-one people and prompting the mall to be closed for three hours.4<br>By the fall <i>90210</i> was the top show, period, among American teenagers and especially teenage girls.5 Within a year, a whopping 69 percent of teenage girls reportedly watched it. By 1993, it was airing in thirty countries.6 Calendars, T-shirts, lunch boxes, backpacks, pillows, and <i>90210</i> Barbie dolls followed. Most fans were utterly devoted, especially in the beginning, arranging their homework, showering, and social schedules around the show and insisting that friends not call them, at all, while it was on (unless girls called each other and watched together while on the phone).7 The show lasted for ten years.<br>To understand the ascendency of enlightened sexism in the twenty-first century, its early scrimmages with embedded feminism, and the way it sought to transform girls&#x2019; desires for power and change into consumerism and profits, we need to revisit the riptides of the early 1990s. One could be forgiven for forgetting that this was, in fact, a time of considerable feminist ferment among women <i>and</i> girls. For while <i>90210</i> addressed teen girls as if their primary concern was where to get the coolest stonewashed jeans (and a blond, tousle-haired hunk to go with), many real-life girls, and their mothers, were expressing a desire for what would eventually come to be known as girl power.<br>Girls and women may not have been in the streets the way they were in 1970, but there was an intense level of feminist agitation and aspiration, especially in the face of what Susan Faludi&#x2019;s best-selling 1991 book labeled, simply enough, <i>Backlash</i>. On the one hand, First Lady Barbara Bush famously warned women, &#x201c;At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child, or a parent.&#x201d; And the <i>Sports Illustrated</i> swimsuit issue was selling more copies than ever. On the other hand, in the song &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t Need You,&#x201d; the Riot Grrrl band Bikini Kill advised men, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t need your atti-fuckin-tude boy&nbsp;... Us girls, we don&#x2019;t need you&nbsp;... Does it scare you that we don&#x2019;t need you?&#x201d; coupled with Bratmobile&#x2019;s full-bore assault on patriarchy in its song &#x201c;Brat Girl,&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna throw this knife right thru yr chest.&#x201d;<br>There was plenty for women to be enraged about in the early 1990s. When Thurgood Marshall, the first African American Supreme Court justice and a pioneer against school desegregation, decided to retire in 1991, President George H. W. Bush nominated Clarence Thomas, a deeply conservative, anti&#x2013;affirmative action African American bureaucrat who had only been a federal judge for two years, to replace him. Many civil rights and women&#x2019;s groups denounced the nomination, and it barely squeaked out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with a 7-to-7 vote. Then, in October, all hell broke loose when the allegations of Anita Hill, a University of Oklahoma law professor who had told the FBI during the background checks on Thomas that he had sexually harassed her, got leaked to the press. Hill had to provide testimony before a riveted national television audience about how Thomas, at work, would start talking to her about &#x201c;acts he had seen in pornographic films involving such matters as women having sex with animals, and films showing group sex or rape scenes.&#x201d; Hill stated that Thomas kept asking her out despite her refusals, kept commenting on her clothes and appearance, and also boasted to Hill &#x201c;graphically of his own sexual prowess,&#x201d; which included references to &#x201c;the size of his own penis being larger than normal.&#x201d; In a truly weird workplace comment, Thomas allegedly asked Hill, &#x201c;Who has put a pubic hair on my Coke?&#x201d;8 This last event struck most women as particularly hard to make up. Yet various of the all-white male Judiciary Committee members&#x2014;in a Senate that was 98 percent male&#x2014;treated Hill dismissively, implying that she may have been delusional. The spectacle of a lone woman, and a black one to boot, sitting across from a patronizing tribunal of rich white guys who seemed to think that sexual harassment was a figment of the female imagination got women&#x2019;s blood boiling.<br>Their wrath was further fanned by the outrageous Tailhook scandal, which exploded in the spring of 1992. The news emerged that the navy had covered up an incident at the Tailhook Association convention in Las Vegas the previous September, when naval aviators formed a gauntlet on the third floor of the Hilton and trapped women in it, pawing and molesting them, stripping off their clothes. The first reports&#x2014;whitewashes&#x2014;identified only two suspects from approximately five thousand Tailhook attendees. Because twenty-six women, fourteen of them officers, claimed to have been assaulted, these findings, you might say, defied credulity. By June the secretary of the navy, H. Lawrence Garrett, faced a full-blown scandal about the cover-up, including the fact that&#x2014;oops&#x2014;fifty-five pages of interviews had been omitted from the final report, including one that placed Garrett himself in at least one of the Tailhook party suites. Time for that pink slip. Garrett quickly resigned, shortly after Paula Coughlin, a helicopter pilot and admiral&#x2019;s aide, appeared on <i>ABC News</i> to describe the ordeal that she and the other women had suffered. That women in the <i>military</i>, no less, could be assaulted in this way only added to the public fury.<br>Energized by Anita Hill, Tailhook, and <i>Backlash</i>, women emerged as a political force in 1992, which the press dubbed &#x201c;The Year of the Woman.&#x201d; In November four women won election to the male-dominated U.S. Senate for the first time in American history: Dianne Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco, and Representative Barbara Boxer in California; Patty Murray, a state senator from Washington who described herself as &#x201c;a mom in tennis shoes,&#x201d; and Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, the first black woman to serve in the Senate. Arlen Specter nearly lost his Senate seat to Lynn Yeakel, a first-time candidate who ran specifically because of her fury over how Specter had questioned Anita Hill during the Thomas hearings.9 A record number of women&#x2014;108&#x2014;ran for Congress, and twenty-four were elected to the House, the largest number ever in any single election.10 Bill Clinton&#x2019;s election as president brought change as well. He made a point of supporting equal rights for women, and in addition to his brainy and accomplished wife who, unlike Barbara Bush, actually had a professional career, he named three women to his first cabinet, a woman to head the Environmental Protection Agency, and the first African American woman to become surgeon general.<br>So the early 1990s indeed seemed a turning point for women starting to achieve political power. Nonetheless, there was also considerable concern about girls not achieving their full potential because of ongoing discrimination in the classroom, and issues like sexual harassment, date rape, and domestic violence were getting more widespread attention. Naomi Wolf&#x2019;s bestseller <i>The Beauty Myth</i> (1991) attacked the impossible standards of physical perfection imposed on us all, and Mary Pipher&#x2019;s <i>Reviving Ophelia</i> (1994), on the bestseller list longer than most of my daughter&#x2019;s hamsters lived, decried the hostile media environment surrounding girls and the decline in self-esteem it produced. So girls and women, after the dormant years of George H. W. Bush, were insisting on new political and social visibility in the early 1990s. At the same time girls, in particular, were emerging as a very important niche market.<br>The war between enlightened sexism and embedded feminism was on. It was in this swirling, contradictory milieu of a renewed press for women&#x2019;s rights, a backlash against these efforts, and the increased cultural, political, and commercial attention to girls that <i>Beverly Hills 90210</i> premiered and flourished along with other media fare that couldn&#x2019;t have been more different, like <i>Murphy Brown</i> or the music of Bratmobile.<br>So why did a seeming piece of fluff like <i>90210</i> matter? And what made the show such a phenomenon with young women? Because ...</p><h2>Second Chance: Three Presidents and the Crisis of American Superpower</h2><p>America's most distinguished commentator on foreign policy, former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, offers a reasoned but unsparing assessment of the last three presidential administrations' foreign policy. Though spanning less than two decades, these administrations cover a vitally important turning point in world history: the period in which the United States, having emerged from the Cold War with unprecedented power and prestige, managed to squander both in a remarkably short time. This is a tale of decline: from the competent but conventional thinking of the first Bush administration, to the well-intentioned self-indulgence of the Clinton administration, to the mortgaging of America's future by the suicidal statecraft&#x201d; of the second Bush administration. Brzezinski concludes with a chapter on how America can regain its lost prestige. This scholarly yet highly opinionated book is sure to be both controversial and influential.</p><p><b>Zbigniew Brzezinski</b>, the National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter, is a counselor and trustee at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a professor of American foreign policy at the School of Advanced International Studies, the Johns Hopkins University, both located in Washington, D.C. His many books include <i>The Choice</i> and <i>The Grand Chessboard</i>. He lives in Washington, D.C.Reviewed by James M. Lindsay<p> The Iraq war has America's foreign policy mavens waxing nostalgic. Partisans of the elder George Bush long for the days when realism and caution reigned in the White House. Bill Clinton's fans fondly recall an era when presidential trips overseas drew admiring crowds rather than angry protesters. U.S. foreign policy, it would seem, should go forward by going backward.</p><p> Zbigniew Brzezinski will have none of that. In his engaging and briskly argued new book, Jimmy Carter's national security adviser sees little worth emulating in the past 15 years of U.S. foreign policy. He asks how Washington has led since becoming the world's first truly global leader after the collapse of the Soviet Union. His answer? "In a word, badly." </p><p> To make that case, Brzezinski grades the performance of presidents Bush, Clinton and Bush -- or, to use the ungainly terms he prefers, Global Leaders I, II and III. Second Chance even comes complete with a full-blown report card. (You can guess which president gets an F.) Brzezinski's unsparing assessments will warm the heart of anyone worried about grade inflation.</p><p> George H.W. Bush, Brzezinski argues, was a superb crisis manager who missed the opportunity to leave a lasting imprint on U.S. foreign policy because he was not a strategic visionary. He earns a solid B. On the other hand, Bill Clinton had the intellect to craft just such a post-Cold War strategy but lacked the discipline and the passion, leading to eight years that produced more drift than direction. He gets an uneven C. Finally, the younger Bush offered "catastrophic leadership" after 9/11 that has already stamped his "presidency as a historical failure." </p><p> These portraits will strike many readers as conventional -- and others as unfair, particularly to the first Bush. Yes, Bush 41 famously foundered with the "vision thing." But then again, less than a year passed between the Soviet Union's demise and his reelection defeat -- not much time to devise, let alone institutionalize, a new world order. And it goes beyond unfair to argue, as Brzezinski does, that had the elder Bush deposed Saddam Hussein when he had the chance in 1991, "a subsequent U.S. president might not have gone to war in Iraq." The younger Bush chose to wage war on Iraq; he was not forced into it by the choices his father made. </p><p> So much for the grades. So what does looking backward tell us about going forward? Brzezinski believes that George W. Bush's choices have been calamitous but not fatal. There's still no other country that can play the role of global leader. So America will get a second chance -- but not a third -- to reclaim the mantle of global leadership.</p><p> As much as Second Chance criticizes Global Leaders I, II and III for failing to devise a sensible geopolitical strategy, it does not offer one of its own. The few specific policy recommendations it does offer are unconvincing. Brzezinski wants to establish an executive-legislative planning mechanism to inject greater coherence into foreign policy. But this proposal fails to realize that consensus can produce bad policies as well as good ones. After all, we plunged into Iraq in 2003 because Congress followed rather than resisted the White House's lead.</p><p>Brzezinski also wants "stricter lobbying laws" because ethnic lobbies have too tight a hold on Uncle Sam's ear. But this exaggerates their importance. Yes, lobbying groups favoring countries such as Israel, Armenia, Greece and Taiwan complicate the lives of policymakers, but they seldom prove decisive on major issues. When they do -- as in the case of the Israel lobby, which Brzezinski believes distorts U.S. policy in the Middle East -- it is not because they mobilize narrow interests but because they can mobilize a broad swath of public opinion. That, for better or worse, is what democracy is all about.</p><p> What Second Chance does offer is a wise insight that should guide any effort to fashion a strategy to restore American leadership. We are in the midst of what Brzezinski rightly calls a "global political awakening." Technology has made global "have-nots" painfully conscious of their relative deprivation. It has also given them the tools to punish those they see as blocking their aspirations. If the United States is to avoid becoming the target of their resentment, its foreign policy must be seen as serving their interests as well as its own. That means exercising self-restraint rather than pressing every advantage that comes to a superpower; it means listening to others and not just working to preserve our own peace and prosperity but helping others to build their own. The Global Leader IV who can find a way to translate these precepts into practical policies should be able to impress even the redoubtable Prof. Brzezinski. </p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

No hiding. No opportunity to put a better spin on what you did. No attorney to represent you. The look in His eyes says it all. Like it or not, standing before Christ is precisely where you and I shall some day be, 'for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ' (2 Corinthians 5:10). And while we will not lose our entrance to heaven if we are believers, what we do in our earthly life will determine our standing in the eternal kingdom. There are eternal consequences to what we do.<br><br>Jesus will not wink at our disobedience. He does not play favorites. We will be rewarded according to our faithfulness. There is no exception, no special deferment. When God calls our name we will be there. We cannot hide, for God will find us; we cannot scheme to make ourselves look good, for God shall see us. We cannot excuse ourselves, for God knows us.<br><br>In <i>Your Eternal Reward</i>, pastor Erwin Lutzer teaches readers not only the effects of the Judgment Seat of Christ and the Great White Throne, but shares what Jesus will be looking for and how we can use the resources of this life to store up treasures in heaven. This life is training for the next. We are to be learning the rules of the kingdom and running the race to win the prize Christ has promised to His faithful servants. When He calls your name, will you hear Him say, 'Well done, good and faithful servant'?<br></p><p><b><i></i></b><p><b><i></i>When we reflect on how we lived for Christ, we might weep on the other side of the celestial gates.</b></p><p>To their own detriment, many Christians have emptied the judgment seat of Christ of its meaning, living like they will never meet His knowing gaze. For this they may have tears in heaven.</p><p>In this provocative book, Dr. Erwin Lutzer argues that remorse in heaven awaits those who don't live fully for God on earth. Exploring the often-overlooked Scriptures about reward and judgment for Christians, Dr. Lutzer answers questions like:</p><ul><li>How will believers be judged?</li><li>Do rewards for faithfulness vary?</li><li>If heaven is perfect, why do rewards even matter?</li></ul><p>His answers are immensely practical. <i>Your Eternal Reward </i>will prompt you to live more faithfully, whether in your conduct, your speech, or even your use of money, that you might enjoy heaven all the more.</p><p>What is sown on earth is reaped in heaven, and Dr. Lutzer will have you taking this truth seriously.</p><b>DR.

Taking this as a starting point, Eric Metaxas founded a speaking series that encouraged busy and successful professionals to attend forums and think actively about the bigger questions in life. Thus <i>Socrates in the City: Conversations on "Life, God, and Other Small Topics"</i> was born.</p><p>This book is for the seeker in all of us, the collector of wisdom, and the person who asks "What if?" Within this collection of original essays that were first given to standing-room-only crowds in New York City are serious thinkers taking on Life, God, Evil, Redemption, and other small topics. Luminaries such as Dr. Francis Collins, Sir John Polkinghorne, Charles Colson, N.T. Wright, Os Guinness, Peter Kreeft, and Jean Bethke Elshatin have written about extraordinary topics vital to both secular and Christian thinking, such as "Making Sense Out of Suffering," "How Good Confronts Evil," and "Belief in God in an Age of Science." No question is too big-in fact, the bigger, the harder, the more complex, the better. These essays are both thought-provoking and entertaining, because nowhere is it written that finding answers to life's biggest questions shouldn't be exciting and even, perhaps, fun.</p></p><p><b>Eric Metaxas</b> is a bestselling author whose biographies, children's books, and works of popular apologetics have been translated into multiple languages around the world.

Eric Metaxas tells Bonhoeffer's story with passion and theological sophistication, often challenging revisionist accounts that make Bonhoeffer out to be a 'humanist' or ethicist for whom religious doctrine was easily disposable . . .

His previous books include <strong>A Forest of Time</strong>, <strong>Native American Testimony</strong>, <strong>Native American Architecture</strong> (with Robert Easton), <strong>Indian Running</strong>, <strong>Two Leggings: The Making of a Crow Warrior</strong>, and <strong>Architecture of Acoma Pueblo</strong>.According to UCLA professor Nabokov (<i>Native American Testimony</i>), the places that American Indians call sacred may be as wondrous as "cliffs spilling with waterfalls" and as humble as "caves splattered with bat excrement." What makes them important is not postcard-perfect beauty but the beliefs a group has about "what lies <i>within</i> or <i>beneath</i> what the eye can see." This excellent volume presents the "biographies" of 16 such places, from Maine to California. Through them, Nabokov surveys a wide range of Native American spiritual practices and reveals how intrusions into Native Americans' land have also constituted assaults upon their religious beliefs. Indeed, many of the assaults continue to this day: after the disruptions caused by war, disease, missionary activity and forced relocation came those of hydroelectric dams, agribusiness, parking lots and extreme sports buffs. Nabokov's deeply informed text is enhanced by first-person accounts of his visits to the locations and by his spirited commentary on the writings of other ethnographers, naturalists, linguists and anthropologists. Sentimental clich�s and monolithic views are dismantled along the way. Each of Nabokov's biographies can be savored separately; taken together, they demonstrate both that there is "more to some American places than [meets] the eye" and that Native Americans have known that for a very long time. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A wise and simple story now in paperback. Winner of a 1993 Western State Book Award.</p><p><p> Velma Wallis was born in 1960 in Fort Yukon, a remote village of about 650 people in Interior Alaska. Growing up in a traditional Athabaskan family, Wallis was one of thirteen children. When she was thirteen, her father died and she left school to help her mother raise her younger siblings. </p> <p> Wallis later moved to her father's trapping cabin, a twelve-mile walk from the village. She lived alone there intermittently for a dozen years, learning traditional skills of hunting and trapping. An avid reader, she passed her high school equivalency exam and began her first literary project-writing down a legend her mother had told her, about two abandoned old women and their struggle to survive. </p> <p> That story became her first book, <i>Two Old Women,</i> published by Epicenter Press in 1993. As her second book, <i>Bird Girl and the Man who Followed the Sun,</i> went to press, Wallis was living in Fort Yukon with her husband, Jeffrey John, and their two children. The family also spends time in the neighboring village of Venetie. </p>The Athabaskan people of Alaska have long told the legend of two old women intentionally left behind by their tribe during a winter of severe starvation. Velma Wallis takes this legend and gives it life, filling in the details of the survival of the women from her own experiences trapping and living in a remote area near Fort Yukon. In her vision, the two women, seventy-five-year-old Sa' and eighty-year-old Ch'idzigyaak, have grown old ungracefully. They still contribute to the tribe, but they tend to complain and believe they must rely upon their walking sticks. When they are deserted, however, their will to live asserts itself and they declare "if we are going to die...let us die trying, not sitting." Leaving their walking sticks behind, they travel, make camps and remember the skills of hunting and survival they learned as girls who shunned the traditional path for young women. When the tribe returns after a year, seeking them out of guilt, they find strong, well-fed, and powerful women who save their tribe from starvation but insist upon maintaining their own hard-won autonomy. Their struggle is not easy; their victory is not simple. Velma Wallis tells their legend in clear, unadorned language, with insights about respect, aging, generosity, and love that will reach young and old. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Erica Bauermeister</i><br><br>Two Old Women: An Alaska Legend of Betrayal, Courage and Survival is a classic Athabascan Indian tale of survival, filled with suspense and wisdom as told by Velma Wallis, an outstanding Native American writer. Her style is a refreshing blend of contemporary and traditional, and her choice of subject matter challenges the taboos of her past. Yet her themes are modern -- empowerment of women, the aging of America, and a growing interest in Native American values. Based on a legend told and retold for many generations in the remote Yukon River region of northeast Alaska, this is the tragic and shocking story (with an unexpected upbeat ending) of two elderly women who are abandoned by a migrating band facing starvation because of unusually harsh Arctic weather and a shortage of fish and game. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>The Book of Gardening Projects for Kids: 101 Ways to Get Kids Outside, Dirty, and Having Fun</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;What better way to begin to explore the natural world than to experience the magic and beauty of a family garden.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Arden Bucklin-Sporer, author of <i>How to Grow a School Garden</i></b><br><br> Many gardeners find that once they have children gardening goes the way of late-night dinner parties and Sunday morning sleep-ins.

In April, months prior to the beginning of play, it was revealed that two All-Star players, Paul Hornung and Alex Karras, were gambling on the sport and would be suspended from play for at least a year. Even worse, in May, one of the league&#x2019;s bigger-than-life personalities, Big Daddy Lipscomb, was found dead, with police saying he perished from a heroin overdose, something those who knew him best still dispute.<br><br>&nbsp;As play began in September, the Pro Football Hall of Fame opened its doors in Canton, Ohio, the same town where the National Football League was founded in 1921 and inducted its first class. Also, the war for players and prestige raged with the upstart American Football League trying to obtain equal footing in the public eye.<br>On the field, it was to be the year the Chicago Bears and their aging owner-coach George Halas knew glory once more, fighting off the latest dynasty Green Bay Packers led by Vince Lombardi in a season-long chase for the Western Division title. Yet even that was overshadowed by the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. While the nation mourned and other sports leagues suspended activity, the NFL played on with its regular season that sad weekend&#x2014;a choice commissioner Pete Rozelle later called the worst mistake of his tenure.<br><br><i>Clouds over the Goalpost</i> is filled with controversy not only on the field, but off it as well. From the various suspensions to an exciting championship game between the Bears and Giants, 1963 was a year that the NFL would never forget&#x2014;for both the good and the bad.</p><p><b>Lew Freedman</b> is the author of nearly sixty books on sports, including <i>Clouds over the Goalpost</i>, <i>The Original Six</i>, and <i>A Summer to Remember</i>, and is the winner of more than 250 journalism awards. A veteran sportswriter, Freedman was formerly a staff writer for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> and <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, as well as other papers, and lives in Columbus, Indiana.Based on the title and subtitle, readers may approach this expecting some larger truths about the state of the nation in 1963, as reflected in the NFL season the year Kennedy was assassinated. They will be disappointed. The gambling suspensions of Paul Hornung and Alex Karras are addressed perfunctorily, and the decision of the NFL to play its games the weekend following JFK&#x2019;s murder is given just slightly more attention. However, readers who just want an exciting account of a dramatic football season with a cast of gridiron immortals such as George Halas, Vince Lombardi, Bart Starr, and Mike Ditka will be richly rewarded. Veteran newspaperman Freedman interviews many of the 1963 season survivors and fills in the gaps with extensive research to lay out a dramatic step-by-step account of the season, a neck-and-neck race between the eventual champion Chicago Bears and their archrivals and defending-champion Green Bay Packers. Freedman offers personal anecdotes and insights into the key characters as well as many of the lesser lights. Enjoyable reading for fans of the NFL and its history. --Wes Lukowsky</p><h2>Rendezvous with Rama,</h2><p>In the year 2130, a huge alien artifact approaches the Earth from outer space. Commander Norton and his crew take their ship to meet it, and, once inside, discover the wonders that go to make up Rama.</p><p>An all-time science fiction classic, <i>Rendezvous with Rama</i> is also one of Clarke's best novels--it won the Campbell, Hugo, Jupiter, and Nebula Awards. A huge, mysterious, cylindrical object appears in space, swooping in toward the sun. The citizens of the solar system send a ship to investigate before the enigmatic craft, called Rama, disappears. The astronauts given the task of exploring the hollow cylindrical ship are able to decipher some, but definitely not all, of the extraterrestrial vehicle's puzzles. From the ubiquitous trilateral symmetry of its structures to its cylindrical sea and machine-island, Rama's secrets are strange evidence of an advanced civilization. But who, and where, are the Ramans, and what do they want with humans? Perhaps the answer lies with the busily working biots, or the sealed-off buildings, or the inaccessible "southern" half of the enormous cylinder. Rama's unsolved mysteries are tantalizing indeed. <i>Rendezvous with Rama</i> is fast moving, fascinating, and a must-read for science fiction fans. Clarke collaborated with Gentry Lee in writing several Rama sequels, beginning with <i>Rama II</i>.At first, only a few things are known about the celestial object that astronomers dub Rama. It is huge, weighing more than ten trillion tons. And it is hurtling through the solar system at inconceivable speed. Then a space probe confirms the unthinkable: Rama is no natural object. It is, incredible, an interstellar spacecraft. Space explorers and planet-bound scientists alike prepare for mankind's first encounter with alien intelligence. It will kindle their wildest dreams... and fan their darkest fears. For no one knows who the Ramans are or why they have come. And now the moment of rendezvous awaits -- just behind a Raman airlock door.<p> "Mr. Clarke is splendid...We experience that chilling touch of the alien, the not-quite-knowable, that distinguishes SF at its most technically imaginative." -- <i>The New York Times</i></p></p><h2>Those We Left Behind (The Belfast Novels)</h2><p><b><b>Blood has always been thicker than water for two Northern Irish brothers caught in the Belfast foster system, but a debt of past violence will be paid by not just them, but also by those they left behind.</b><br></b><br>Ciaran Devine, who made Belfast headlines seven years ago as the &#x201c;schoolboy killer,&#x201d; is about to walk free.

But DCI Serena Flanagan, the only officer who could convince a young, frightened Ciaran to speak, has silently harbored doubts about his confession all this time.<br><br>Ciaran&#x2019;s release means several things: a long-anticipated reunion with Thomas, who still wields a dangerous influence over his younger brother; the call-to-action of a man bent on revenge for his father&#x2019;s death; and major trouble for Ciaran&#x2019;s assigned probation officer. Meanwhile, Serena Flanagan has just returned to the force from her battle with breast cancer, only to endure the pitying looks of her coworkers and a mountain of open case files. She will soon discover that even closed cases can unleash terror on the streets of Belfast.</p><p>Stuart Neville is the author of five other books: <i>Ratlines</i>, shortlisted for the CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger for Best Thriller; <i>Collusion</i>, a finalist for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize; <i>Stolen Souls</i>, which <i>The Guardian</i> said &#x201c;confirms him as the king of Belfast noir&#x201d;; <i>The Final Silence</i>, nominated for the Edgar Award for Best Novel; <i>The Ghosts of Belfast</i>, winner of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize and a finalist for the Macavity Award, the Barry Award, and the Anthony Award for Best First Novel; and <i>So Say the Fallen</i>.

She had felt no surprise when Edward Hughes called her to his office. The file had been waiting for her on the boss&#x2019;s desk, half an inch of reports, assessments and evaluations. It pulled a bitter curse from her throat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; City centre traffic hummed and rattled beneath Hughes&#x2019;s window, car horns sounding, someone whistling for a taxi. She turned the pages while Hughes chewed a pen at the other side of the desk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A single photograph of Ciaran Devine at the front, hollow eyes and blank face, a little boy long gone.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They&#x2019;d used the same picture in the Sunday red top she&#x2019;d read at the weekend. <i>Schoolboy Killer to Be Released</i>, the headline had screamed above a half-page story.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She knew as soon as she saw it. Just knew.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Any way out of this?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes shook his head. &#x201c;None at all. The young fella needs your experience.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What about Terry Grimes?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Terry&#x2019;s tied up. It&#x2019;s your case, and that&#x2019;s all there is to it. You can handle him. He&#x2019;s been good as gold on his temporary releases. Tom Wheatley at the hostel says he was no bother at all when he stayed over.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy would have had excursions accompanied by one of his case managers. Shopping trips, a meal at McDonald&#x2019;s, a walk in the park. Finally, they would have allowed him a night in the hostel off the Saintfield Road, in the south of the city.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She pictured him sitting in the small, clean room, perhaps counting coins in the palm of his hand, trying to grasp the simple acts other people took for granted. Going to a shop counter, asking for what he wanted, saying please and thank you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cunningham remembered taking a lifer called Brian to a newsagent&#x2019;s. He had mumbled, &#x201c;Polo mints, please.&#x201d; The shopkeeper had set the sweets on the counter. Brian, who had strangled his girlfriend to death after a drinking binge, had grabbed the packet, dropped a twenty-pound note in its place, and walked out of the shop.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she&#x2019;d caught up with him, his change in her hand, Cunningham asked why.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brian had stood there on the pavement, blinking tears from his eyes, before he said, &#x201c;Cause I don&#x2019;t know what they cost.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove a man from the world for years then drop him back into it, expecting him to simply pick up where he left off. It doesn&#x2019;t work. He&#x2019;ll be lost. And Ciaran Devine would be no different.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cunningham had entered the Probation Service twelve years ago, not long after gaining her MSc in clinical psychology. As a postgraduate student, she had spent summers working on the wards of psychiatric units, then a year in Maghaberry prison, counselling inmates. She had learned things in those days that would stay with her until her last breath, like the terrible cost of casual violence, and how poorly the system dealt with those who inflicted it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all those dozen years, Cunningham wasn&#x2019;t sure if she&#x2019;d ever done any good.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She let the air out of her lungs, wished for a cigarette. &#x201c;All right,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;When&#x2019;s the ADR?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He gets out Wednesday. That gives you a week to prepare.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Jesus, how am I supposed to prepare for this?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes put his forearms on the desk. &#x201c;In a thorough, diligent and professional manner.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cunningham glanced at him over the open file. He probably thought he was giving her his serious face, but he looked more like a prissy matron. Edward Hughes was on the large side, yet he had a countenance more like that of a schoolboy than a man well into middle age.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What about the brother?&#x201d; Cunningham asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Thomas? He&#x2019;s kept out of trouble since his release. He&#x2019;s not supervised anymore.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The newspaper had also carried a picture of Thomas Devine, smaller than that of Ciaran, tucked away on the second page. Older, leaner, darker. Handsome like his brother, but in a sharper, more jagged way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An image flashed in her mind: the boys escorted towards the side entrance of the courthouse, blankets over their heads, a uniformed policeman at each arm, followed by the detectives who got the confession, brilliant camera flashes, screams of hatred from the onlookers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one knew the boys&#x2019; names then, the press ordered to keep quiet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t go for a Mary Bell order?&#x201d; Cunningham asked. A new identity, a lifetime of secrets, named after a little English girl who did two unspeakable things almost half a century before.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Thomas gave it a go,&#x201d; Hughes said. &#x201c;The judge threw it out. He didn&#x2019;t reckon they were under sufficient threat.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The names had appeared in the papers more than a year and a half ago when Ciaran had turned eighteen. His minimum tariff of six years had expired, but he continued to be held at the Secretary of State&#x2019;s Pleasure. The local Belfast journalists salivated over a potential release, stored up their bile and outrage. Politicians gave stiff-lipped opinions that amounted to nothing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;God help him,&#x201d; Cunningham whispered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hadn&#x2019;t meant to say it out loud. She glanced up at Hughes, expecting a reproach.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said, &#x201c;God help the both of you.&#x201d;<br><br><b>2</b><br>Detective Chief Inspector Serena Flanagan punched in her key code and entered the station&#x2019;s core. A walled compound containing a cluster of redbrick buildings, small windows, a fortress in the heart of Lisburn, built to shield its occupants from bullets and bombs. Flanagan avoided all stares, averted her eyes, as she made her way to the second floor and the office she hadn&#x2019;t seen in four months. Whispers followed her through the corridors and stairwells.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; a voice called.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flanagan pretended she hadn&#x2019;t heard it, kept walking, her door only a few yards away now.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stopped, gave a silent curse, and turned.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detective Inspector John Hoey, a coffee in one hand, a sheaf of papers in the other. Flanagan offered a smile, a nod.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Good to see you back,&#x201d; he said as he approached. &#x201c;How are you feeling?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not bad,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Looking forward to getting to work.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I see your hair grew back.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flanagan had turned to leave, but his words stopped her. &#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;From your treatment.&#x201d; He raised his coffee cup, pointing a finger at her head. His face dropped. &#x201c;Oh. Is it a wig?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flanagan took a breath. Gave him a patient smile. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t have chemotherapy,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Just radiotherapy. So I didn&#x2019;t lose my hair.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Oh, good. I was wondering, will you be getting your team back together?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;As soon as I get caught up, see who&#x2019;s still available.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to be considered,&#x201d; Hoey said. &#x201c;Just so you know. If you need the numbers made up.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bear it in mind,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flanagan turned, left him there, and headed for her office. She let herself in, closed the door behind her, leaned her back against it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from Hoey&#x2019;s crass stupidity, she thought, that wasn&#x2019;t so bad. She&#x2019;d been dreading the return for weeks. The looks of pity. The expressions of sympathy. They would come, that much was certain, but she felt that perhaps she could at least be gracious in response.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six weeks after her surgery, she had been in Tesco browsing loaves of bread. She had nudged her trolley against another shopper, turned to apologise, and recognised a work colleague of her husband&#x2019;s. Heather Foyle, she was called, a maths teacher.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heather had stared at Flanagan, eyes and mouth agape, visibly struggling to find a few words.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;For Christ&#x2019;s sake, I didn&#x2019;t die,&#x201d; Flanagan said before wheeling her trolley to the checkouts, her face burning, regret already souring her stomach.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had called Heather later that evening to apologise, battled through the no-don&#x2019;t-mention-its, tried to explain herself against the tide of condescension. Even then, when she knew she was entirely in the wrong, aware that Heather Foyle was simply being a good person, Flanagan had to stamp on her own anger. She had never experienced the pity of others until her breast cancer diagnosis, and it was more unpalatable than she had ever imagined.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, only Hoey, his clumsy words and his expedient sympathy as he fished for opportunities. She could take that. There would be more to come, and she would smile and say, I&#x2019;m fine, thank you, and ask after the enquirer&#x2019;s well-being, and most definitely not shout at him or her to shut up, just leave her alone, let her get on with living.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flanagan&#x2019;s office remained as dim as she remembered, sunlight muted by the tinted glass in a window so small it served little purpose. And hot, too. She crossed the room, opened the window to its full extent, which was no more than a couple of inches. For her own protection, her superiors would have said. This building looked like a small prison from the outside, and often felt like one within. Across the rooftops, she could just see the spires of Christ Church. Flanagan counted herself lucky; most of the views from this station were of walls and wire fences.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took off her jacket, slung it over the back of her chair, and sat down. The quiet of the room seemed to press on her, a physical sensation, as if the silence hardened the air.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three framed photographs sat on her desk, one portrait of each of her children, and another picture of the family. One of those terrible posed studio shots that she disliked, but Alistair had insisted. She&#x2019;d turned the frames face down the last time she left the office. To keep the dust off them, she&#x2019;d told herself, but part of her believed it was to shield her family from the goings on here.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flanagan set each of them upright and was startled by how young Ruth and Eli looked, how much they had changed, and she felt a strange sadness for the smaller children they&#x2019;d left behind in these images.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sharp rap of knuckle on wood made her jump. She exhaled and said, &#x201c;Come.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detective Superintendent Stephen Purdy opened the door. A stocky bespectacled man with a shock of pure black hair that some speculated was a wig. Flanagan had inspected it as closely as she could and found no evidence to back up the claim, though<br>she suspected he dyed it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to see you back,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;How are you feeling?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, sir, thank you,&#x201d; she said, hoping he wouldn&#x2019;t ask her to elaborate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DSI Stephen Purdy was not an idiot like Hoey. He lacked emotional intelligence, found casual conversation difficult, but he was not stupid. He would know not to push her on her illness.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Good, good,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She indicated the seat in front of her desk as she sat down.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not stopping.&#x201d; He hovered there, looking as comfortable as a mouse in a cattery.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was up to Flanagan to set him free. &#x201c;What can I do for you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ah, well, first of all I wanted to welcome you back.&#x201d; He dipped his head and waved a hand in a bowing gesture. &#x201c;And to get you started on some work.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flanagan had noticed the file under Purdy&#x2019;s arm when he first entered her office. He placed the manila folder on the desk and tapped it with his index finger.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This was sent over from B District. You know DCI Thompson&#x2019;s retiring in a few weeks? He&#x2019;s leaving a lot of unfinished business behind him. Between you and me, his MIT had become a bit of a shambles. These are the loose ends from the last few cases he&#x2019;s left open. The ACC wants you to work through them, see what&#x2019;s still worth following up, what&#x2019;s better off dropped, that kind of thing. He thought it might keep you occupied while you get settled in again. I can let you have a few DCs if you need the help. There&#x2019;s a new DS, Ballantine, she&#x2019;s very capable. Now that Calvin&#x2019;s abandoned us, she might make a good starting point for a team.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detective Sergeant Calvin had been Flanagan&#x2019;s assistant on her Major Investigation Team. He&#x2019;d suffered a shoulder wound before she had taken leave for her surgery, and that had been enough for him. The Police Federation had helped him push for a medical pension, and then he was off.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t imagine she&#x2019;ll want to start off pushing paper around for you,&#x201d; Purdy said, &#x201c;but we all have to do it sometimes.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flanagan felt a growing weight inside. A file full of busywork and drudgery, sweeping up someone else&#x2019;s mess.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purdy saw the disappointment on her. &#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been out of action for weeks. You can&#x2019;t expect just to land back here and dive into a hot case. It&#x2019;ll be a month or more until you&#x2019;ve got a proper team established again. I can&#x2019;t have you twiddling your thumbs for all that time.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She waved at the file. &#x201c;I know, but this . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purdy gave her his sternest look, usually reserved for the lower ranks. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not exciting work, I know, but there are victims in those pages that still need someone to speak for them.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Flanagan said, feeling like an admonished child. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. I&#x2019;ll get working.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purdy nodded and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll leave you to it.&#x201d; He stopped at the door. &#x201c;Oh, I meant to say. You heard about the Devine boy?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That he&#x2019;s due for release, yes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Wednesday,&#x201d; Purdy said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That soon?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not supposed to know that. They&#x2019;re keeping it quiet to stop the press going after him. A call came in last week from the probation officer who&#x2019;s been assigned to him. She wants a word with you. I told her to come by today, late morning. All right?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She remembered Ciaran Devine, a child then, a young man now.

Having spent the last few years travelling extensively in Latin America, he has returned to the Midwest and has recently received his degree in journalism from the University of Missouri-Columbia. &#34;The saying &#39;You travel the world only to return and se your home for the first time&#39; really rings true for me,&#34; he said. &#34;This project has opened my eyes to a richness I had previously overlooked.&#34; Brett spends his off-hours getting tangled up in words, traveling and exploring with his girlfriend, Tawnee, and his dog, Daisy.In 1986, the Missouri-Kansas-Texas (MK&amp;T) Railroad (better known as the Katy) ceased operation on its route from Sedalia to Machens. This presented the chance for an extraordinary recreational facility-a 200-mile-long flat hiking and biking trail. Nationwide, railroads are currently being abandoned at the rate of 2,000 miles per year. <p> Through a rails-to-trails program, old railroad corridors are banked for future transportation needs and used on an interim basis as recreational trails. Though Katy Trail enthusiasts were first met by stiff opposition from many landowners who felt the deeded railroad land should be returned to them, trail proponents eventually won out. Because of a generous donation by Edward "Ted" D. Jones Jr., the Missouri Department of Natural Resources was able to secure the right-of-way. A subsequent donation is allowing further trail development. According to the Rails-To-Trails Conservancy, the number of rails-to-trails conversions across the United States has jumped from 75 in 1986 to a current total of 921 in 48 states spanning 8,000 miles of America's most beautiful landscape. There are also another 1,069 miles in development. Some are short mile-long segments of old railroad line. Only six are more than 100 miles in length. The Katy Trail State Park, at 185 miles, is America's longest rails-to-trails project. Rails-to-Trails projects are as diverse as our national landscape. Some, like Seattle's Burke-Gilman Trail, hug urban centers and are used by an estimated 1,000,000 commuters and bikers every year. By contrast, the Katy Trail is nestled in rural seclusion, allowing hikers and bikers to travel through some of the most scenic areas of Missouri. The majority of the trail follows the Missouri River, beside some of the most fertile agricultural land in the country, and beside towering limestone bluffs. The trail travels through many types of landscapes including dense forests, wetlands, deep valleys, open pastureland and gently rolling farm fields. Though scheduled for completion in 1994, the flood of 1993 damaged 75 of the original 126 miles. The trail's grand opening (the connecting of east and west trail sections) finally occurred in September 1996. Currently, 185 miles of the Katy Trail are open, from Sedalia to St. Charles. Sections from Clinton to Sedalia and from St. Charles to Machens are currently underway and may be completed during the 1998 season. 20 Commonly Asked Trail Questions 1. Who runs this park? The Katy Trail State Park is operated by the Department of Natural Resources, which also operates Missouri's 80 other state parks and historic sites. 2. Is the trail hilly? On the contrary. This site was selected by the railroad for its flatness. Trail grades seldom reach more than 5 percent. 3. Where's the bathroom? Trailheads have bathrooms-from port-a-potties to permanent facilities. 4. How many miles will I average in an hour? Walkers average 1-3 miles an hour. Cyclists 5-20 miles an hour. 5. May I camp anywhere along the trail? No. Camping is allowed only in privately operated campgrounds. See the Campers' Notes and Campground Quick Reference Guide for information. 6. Should we take our kids? Definitely! Many trailside bike shops even rent bike trailers for toddlers. 7. Is trailside medical assistance available? Medical assistance would come from the nearest town. To assure fast response time, note the nearest mile marker or geographic landmark before going for help. 8. What is the trail surface like? The trail is covered with a fine crushed limestone surface. This rock packs down almost like pavement. Chat can be as hard and smooth as pavement when dry, but be prepared for wash-outs after heavy rains. Beware of soft shoulders. 9. What happened to the old tracks? The Katy railroad sold the salvage rights to an independent company that came in and removed the iron rails and wooden ties. 10. What's the best time to see wildlife along the trail? The best time to spot wildlife is at dawn or at dusk. You may see Red-tailed Hawks soaring above you and American Bald Eagles in the winter. (Missouri has more eagles in the winter than any other state.) Migratory birds, including Great Blue Herons, Sandpipers, Canada Geese and Belted Kingfishers are also common. If you want to learn about nature along the trail, check out Pebble Publishing's River Valley Companion Nature Guide. This illustrated guide identifies commonly seen trees, wildflowers, leaves, birds, wildlife, cloud formations, fossils, footprints, nasty stuff, insects and more. See the back of this book for more info. 11. Why are the towns so perfectly spaced at 10-15 mile intervals? While the railroad was a dependable way to get products to larger markets around the nation, local travel was still primitive and restricted to a few miles. Towns were spaced every ten miles to make the railroad accessible for farmers hauling their products to market.12. It's raining again. What's the next best thing to riding the trail? Surf up the Missouri and visit the Interactive Katy Trail online, where it never rains! For "cyberhikers" around the world! See the back of the book for more info. 13. I'd like to plan a trip along the trail, but I still have so many questions! See the Bikers Bulletin Board at the back of the book for more trip-planning suggestions. You can also receive a free color brochure on the Katy Trail from the Department of Natural Resources by calling toll-free 1 (800) 334-6946. 14. What kind of bike should I bring to ride? Most trail riders use mountain bikes for their relatively upright riding position. Many bikers also use ten-speed-style road bikes. Hybrids, which are a cross between mountain bikes and ten-speeds, are also very well suited for the trail. Look throughout the book for additional Bikers Notes. 15. I'd like to ride the trail but don't own a bike or can't get it to the trail. No sweat! There are bike rentals available up and down the trail in many different towns. Mountain bikes, tandems and toddler trailers are among the choices, and prices generally range from $5-10 an hour to $15-20 for the day. 16. What's the best time of year to come? Spring and fall are by far the most popular seasons for extended trips along the Katy. Spring bathes the trail in dazzling greens and the trail is showered with flowering dogwoods and redbuds. Fall is also a favorite season, when sugar maple, sumacs and bittersweets explode in hues of orange and red. Late March begins the peak time for trail enjoyment and continues on through November. Summers are usually warm and humid. A typical July day, during the hottest month, may be around 60 degrees at sunrise and 85 degrees by noon. 17. How safe is the trail? There are Katy Trail State Park rangers patrolling the Katy Trail. I've never heard of any safety problems along the trail, and given the trail's rural Missouri setting, I don't expect to hear any stories of problems any time soon. 18. Do I need to bring a bike lock? At most trailside stops, your bike should be within sight and fine. I've ridden the trail many times and couldn't even tell you where my lock is at. I've never felt a need for one. At night, I ask the campground or hotel to lock my bike up and that frees me from carrying a bulky lock with me. Obviously, use your own discretion for each situation. 19. What will I probably forget to bring and regret for the rest of the trip? Shades, sunscreen and long-sleeved shirts to screen you from the direct summer sun. Mosquito repellant or Avon's Skin-So-Soft is also helpful. 20. OK, what will I really regret for the rest of the trip? Not having a more padded bike seat. These can be purchased at various trailside bike shops. Or, wrap your extra tire tube around your seat and mildly inflate it for a much more cushy ride. It works!</p></p><h2>The Reckoning</h2><p>Five years after the slaying of Simon de Montfort has assured the throne for Henry III, Llewelyn ap Gruffydd--Simon&#39;s friend and ally--awaits the chaos he is certain will erupt in the land</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a publisher I have been lucky to be able to visit bookstores all over the country, independent and chain alike. What interests me first about these stores is what titles are being displayed in the 'Staff Recommends' section of the store. It is here that you can find treasured, beloved books quite dear to someone who works in the stores, someone waiting quite eagerly for the chance to hand sell their recommended titles.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in these Staff Recommend sections that I kept on seeing our Penman's titles, HERE BE DRAGONS, FALLS THE SHADOW, THE RECKONING and also SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR and WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT.<br>It's funny, you can sell something for years before you notice that the author has been quietly making a powerful impact on people everywhere.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started with HERE BE DRAGONS and I have never looked back. Her trilogy of the decline of the Welsh kings ( DRAGON, FALLS THE SHADOW and THE RECKONING)is a holiday gift I give year after year, and I'm happy to say they have always been embraced and loved. From my 15 year old niece to my 70 year old mother and many ages in between, all readers are enchanted and transported to a land and an age gone forever. But Penman makes them live forever in our minds and hearts with fantastic, unforgettable characters and wonderful history. HERE BE DRAGONS is such a great title--medieval mapmakes would write those words across any part of the map that was unknown.. a wonderful metaphor for how little the Welsh and English knew of each other.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR--Warning: This is not Shakespeare's Richard III. In this novel, Richard is a victim of circumstance and man vilified by the Tudors, but here presented as a decent and normal man, a man of conscience.<br>AND he is not a murderer. Yes, those princes did die, but not by Richard's hand.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT<p>Another wonderful title, for it refers to the 15 years of England's darkest time-the civil war between the cousins Queen Maud and King Steven. England was deserted, for Christ and his saints were sleeping. I had never even heard of these royals. Queen Maud was the legitimate heir to the throne, but a woman, and there fore not fit to rule. She is also the mother of Henry, who later married Eleanor of Aquitaine . Pretty heady stuff, more incredible men and women, another book to get totally lost in. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has been years since all these books were first published, I can name 5 stores I have been in in the past 3 months that have one of these titles in the Staff Recommends section.<br><br>-Alice Kesterson, Ballantine Regional Sales Manger</p>"Penman's characters are so shrewdly imagined, so full of resonant human feeling that they seem to be on the page....Most compelling is the portrait of the Welsh as wild and rugged as their landscape."<br>SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE<br>Here, alive from the pages of history, is the compelling tale of a Celtic society ruled by Llewelyn, Prince of Wales, on a collison course with a feudal realm of Edward I. WIth this last book in the extraordinary trilogy that began with HERE BE DRAGONS and continued in FALLS THE SHADOW, Sharon Kay Penman has written a beautiful and moving conclusion to her medieval saga. For everyone who has read the earlier books in this incomparable series or ever wanted to experience the rich tapestry of British history and lore, this bold and romantic adventure must be read.</p><h2>Jazz Rhythm and The Improvised Line (Jazz Improvisation, No. 2)</h2><p>A brilliant and schematic history of two important aspects of jazz.

This American family album is deeply moving in its simplicity: "Damn you, brotherwhy didn't you come back? . . . I still love you, and I'd love you if you came back in one piece, or your arms or legs or mind gone." Among the 75 poignant color and black-and-white pictures photographed with respect, a child is lifted by a veteran to plant a kiss on a name; flowers, teddy bears, flags and uniforms grace the polished black granite. In his introduction, Vietnam veteran and freelance writer Norman discusses the controversy over the Wall's design and mourns a friend who substituted for him on patrol: "He may have died for his country or for his God or for nothing at all. For a long time, I thought he died for me." 150,000 first printing; BOMC featured selection. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ten Days That Shook the World (Bantam Classics)</h2><p>John Reed conveys, with the immediacy of cinema, the impression of a whole nation in ferment and disintegration. A contemporary journalist writing in the first flush of revolutionary enthusiasm, he gives us a record of the events in Petrograd in November 1917, when Lenin and the Bolsheviks finally siezed power. Containing verbatim reports both of speeches by leaders and the chance comments of bystanders set against an idealized backcloth of the proletariat soldiers, sailors, and peasants uniting to throw off oppression, Reed&#39;s account is the product of passionate involvement.</p><p>The situation in St. Petersburg was growing more and more tense. The People's Revolution had begun by overthrowing the corrupt Tsarist regime in March 1917, but the workers and the peasants felt the revolution had much farther to go. Tired of fighting a war that meant little to them, the soldiers also grew restless: "When the land belongs to the peasants, and the factories to the workers, and the power to the Soviets, then we'll know we have something to fight for, and we'll fight for it!"<p> Lenin pressed the Bolsheviks to seize power. On the night of October 24, an organized mass of workers, soldiers, peasants, and sailors stormed the Winter Palace. On the following day, at the opening of the second Congress of Soviets, Trotsky announced the overthrow of the provisional government. Counterrevolutionary forces marched on the capital, but the Revolutionary Army triumphed. After all, "[t]his was <i>their</i> battle, for <i>their</i> world; the officers in command were elected by <i>them</i>. For the moment that incoherent multiple will was one will."</p><p> In <i>Ten Days That Shook the World</i> John Reed tells the story of Red October and the Russian revolution from a unique, firsthand perspective. Reed, an American journalist, was on assignment in Russia for <i>The Masses</i>--then the principal radical journal in the United States--and spent his days walking the streets, reading and collecting handbills, newspapers, and posters, and talking to people. As a result, <i>Ten Days</i> crackles with energetic immediacy. At its best moments it reads like a novel: Reed recounts conversations and arguments, details political machinations, and speculates on personal motives. Though this is no mere piece of propaganda, Reed's enthusiasm for the revolution infuses the text (some readers may be put off by Reed's florid prose), casting each counterrevolutionary act in a negative light. Helpful notes flesh out the background for those less familiar with the preceding events and render this a solid work of history. <i>Ten Days That Shook the World</i> is a stirring account of a stirring event. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p><b>John Reed (1887-1920)</b> was a journalist, activist, poet, and author. In addition to chronicling the Russian revolution, he reported on US labor strikes, the Mexican revolution, World War I, and was a founder of and international delegate for the Communist Labor Party. He is buried at the Kremlin Wall in Moscow.<br></p><h2>Hustle Believe Receive: An 8-Step Plan to Changing Your Life and Living Your Dream (51 Stories to Prove It)</h2><p>In <i>Hustle Believe Receive</i>, Sarah Centrella, author of the internationally popular blog Thoughts.Stories.Life., proves that anyone, no matter where they start from, can change their life, achieve success, and live their dream.<br><br>As a single mom living on food stamps, Sarah completely changed her life of poverty to enable her to live her dream in just eighteen months.

Climbing the rickety ladder to decorate the nine-foot Christmas tree was definitely the lesser of two evils.<br> <br>Lance was five months into a six-month sentence at the San Leandro County Juvenile Justice Center facility in the Hill Country some fifty miles northwest of Austin. All his life he had hated having a December birthday&#x2014;hated having whatever he was getting for his birthday and Christmas lumped into a single gift that never measured up to what other kids got. This year, though, his turning eighteen on December 18 meant that Lance would be out of jail in time for Christmas&#x2014;out and able to go home. The problem with that, of course, was that he might not have a home to go to.<br> <br>The last time he&#x2019;d seen his mother, on visiting day two weeks ago, she had told him that she was probably going to lose the house. She&#x2019;d finally admitted to him that she&#x2019;d had to take out a second mortgage in order to pay the king&#x2019;s ransom he owed in court-ordered restitution. Now that her hours had been cut back at work, she wasn&#x2019;t able to keep up the payments on both mortgages. Which meant that, most likely, the house would go into foreclosure.<br> <br>That was all his fault, too. Ears reddening with shame, Lance climbed down the ladder, moved it a few inches toward the next undecorated section of branches, picked up another tray of decorations, and clambered back up.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t think about it, he told himself firmly. What was it the counselor kept saying? Don&#x2019;t waste your time worrying about things you can&#x2019;t change.<br> <br>This definitely fell into the category of stuff that couldn&#x2019;t be changed. What&#x2019;s done was done.<br> <br>He heard a burst of laughter from the classroom. It was just off the dining room. The kids were probably giving Mrs. Stone hell again. He felt sorry for her. She seemed like a nice enough person, and he knew she was genuinely trying to help them. But what she was offering&#x2014;course work leading up to earning a GED&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t at all what Lance wanted. It had never been part of what he had envisioned as his own future.<br> <br>A year ago, just last May, his future had been promising. As a high school junior honor student at San Leandro High, Lance had been enrolled in three Advanced Placement classes and had done well on his SATs, coming in with a respectable 2290. With the help of his beloved math teacher, Mr. Jackson, Lance had been preparing to lead his computer science club team to their third consecutive championship for that year&#x2019;s Longhorn computer science competition.<br> <br>Now his life had changed, and not for the better. Mr. Jackson was dead. Lance&#x2019;s mother had told him that San Leandro High had won the Longhorn trophy after all, but without Lance&#x2019;s help, because someone else was the team captain now. As for doing his senior year in the top 10 percent of his class and getting to wear whatever he wanted to school? That had changed, too. Now Lance found himself locked up twenty-four hours a day and with nothing to wear but orange jumpsuits. The state of Texas offered college scholarships to kids in the top 10 percent of their respective classes, but he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to take advantage of that, either. Lance was now officially considered to be a high school dropout with an institution-earned GED as his best possible educational outcome. No matter what his SAT score said, trying to get into Texas A&amp;M, or any college, with only a lowly GED to his credit wasn&#x2019;t going to work.<br> <br>The problem was that the GED class was the only one offered inside the facility. Some of the other kids were able to take online classes, but since Lance&#x2019;s sentence stipulated no computer or Internet access, those classes weren&#x2019;t available to him. His court-mandated restrictions made the GED the only route possible. It was also boring as hell.<br> <br>Lance had looked at the questions on the sample test. He already knew he could ace the thing in a heartbeat without having to sit through another dreary minute of class. Mrs. Stone probably understood that as well as he did. That was why she had let him out of class yesterday and today. That way he got to deal with the Christmas-tree issue, and she got to look after the dummies. Not that his classmates were really dumb, at least not all of them. Several of the guys spoke no English. He suspected that several of them probably had issues with dyslexia. One of those, a fifteen-year-old named Jason who couldn&#x2019;t read at all, filled his books with caricatures of Mrs. Stone. The pencil drawings were realistic enough in that you could tell who it was. They were also unrealistic in that Mrs. Stone was usually pictured nude, and not in a nice way.<br> <br>All of which left Lance dealing with the Christmas tree. It was big and came in four separate pieces. It was old&#x2014;ten years, at least, according to Mr. Dunn, the grizzled old black man who was in charge of maintenance at the facility. He was the one who had enlisted Lance&#x2019;s help to drag the tree and the boxes of decorations out of storage.<br> <br>&#x201c;No money for a new tree,&#x201d; Mr. Dunn said. &#x201c;Not in the budget, but at least I got us some new lights. By the time we took the tree down last year, half those old lights had quit working. We&#x2019;ll have to restring it before we put it up.&#x201d;<br> <br>That part of the project had taken the better part of a day. First they&#x2019;d removed the old strings of lights. Then they&#x2019;d taken the new ones out of their boxes and wound them into the branches, carefully positioning the plug-in ends close enough to the tree trunk so that all the lights could be fastened together easily once the pieces were dropped into place. It was time-consuming, tedious work, but Lance liked the careful way Mr. Dunn went about it, his methodical method of testing each new string of lights before letting Lance take them out of the box. &#x201c;No sense in putting on a defective string that won&#x2019;t light up the first time you plug it in,&#x201d; Mr. Dunn muttered under his breath.<br> <br>The way Mr. Dunn talked as he worked, more to himself than to anyone else, reminded Lance of Grandpa Frank, his father&#x2019;s father back in Arizona. Lance missed Grandpa Frank, but his grandfather, along with his entire collection of aunts, uncles, and cousins, had disappeared when his parents got a divorce. It wasn&#x2019;t fair. Just because parents couldn&#x2019;t get along shouldn&#x2019;t mean that the poor kids involved had to lose everybody.<br> <br>Lance&#x2019;s favorite memory of Grandpa Frank was going with him to the state fair in Phoenix, where he ate so much cotton candy that he ended up getting sick on the Ferris wheel. The attendant had given him hell while cleaning up the mess. At the time, Lance had been beyond embarrassed, but Grandpa Frank had laughed it off. &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Crap happens. You clean up your own mess, tell the world to piss off, and get on with your life. You want some more cotton candy?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lance had not wanted any more cotton candy. Ever. And he wished he&#x2019;d been able to talk to Grandpa Frank after he got into trouble. His advice probably would have been a lot like some of the things the counselor said, only more colorful. Unfortunately, sometime between the divorce and now, Grandpa Frank had dropped dead of a heart attack or maybe a stroke. Lance didn&#x2019;t know for sure. If his parents had been able to talk to each other, Lance might have had more information&#x2014;might even have been able to go back to Phoenix for the funeral&#x2014;but that didn&#x2019;t happen. Grandpa Frank was gone without Lance even being able to say goodbye.<br> <br>&#x201c;You gonna hand me another string of them lights?&#x201d; Mr. Dunn asked. &#x201c;Or are you gonna stand there all day staring into space?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jarred out of his Grandpa Frank reverie, Lance fumbled another string of lights out of a box and plugged it in to the outlet. The new one lit right up, just as they all had, but as Mr. Dunn said, &#x201c;Better safe than sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know prelit trees could be so much trouble,&#x201d; Lance remarked.<br> <br>&#x201c;They are if you think you can keep &#x2019;em forever,&#x201d; Mr. Dunn replied, &#x201c;but with budgets as tight as they are, we&#x2019;re lucky to get the new lights.&#x201d;<br> <br>When the tree was finally upright and glowing with hundreds of brand-new multicolored lights, Mr. Dunn studied it for a moment and then shook his head. &#x201c;Tomorrow&#x2019;s my day off. Ms. Stone tells me you&#x2019;re gonna be the one putting on the decorations.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lance shrugged. &#x201c;Fine with me,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Before I take off tonight, I&#x2019;ll leave everything you need in the closet next to my office, and I&#x2019;ll make sure the guy who comes in tomorrow knows what&#x2019;s what. The flocking&#x2019;s looking pretty sorry these days. I got us some glitter and some self-adhesive glue. Before you put on the decorations, spray some glue on the tree and toss some glitter on it. That&#x2019;s supposed to make it look a little better.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Lance said. &#x201c;Will do.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Dunn turned to him. &#x201c;You seem like a good kid,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not like some of them other ornery ones. What the hell are you doing here?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lance bit his lip. That was the whole problem: He was a good kid. He never should have been locked up here, but he didn&#x2019;t want to go into it, not with this old man. &#x201c;Long story,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Mr. Dunn shook his head sadly. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t they all!&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Which brought Lance to the next day, when he was working on his own. Marvin Cotton, one of the guards, had opened the door to the closet next to Mr. Dunn&#x2019;s office. Had Mr. Dunn been there, he for sure would have helped Lance carry all the stuff into the rec room. Marvin was only a couple of years older than Lance. The guy was thick-necked, stupid, and surly, and he probably didn&#x2019;t have a college degree. He wandered in and out of the rec room from time to time to check on things, without saying a word or even nodding in Lance&#x2019;s direction. But then there were plenty of guards who acted like that&#x2014;who treated the prisoners as something less than human.<br> <br>Rather than worry about Marvin, Lance concentrated on the tree. For as long as he could remember, decorating Christmas trees had been high on his list of favorite things to do. Not this time. At home, they always had a live tree, although his mother usually bought them late on Christmas Eve, when they were already marked down and cheap. That meant that the trees they had were the rejects&#x2014;scrawny, uneven, and downright ugly, but his mom made sure they always did the decorating together: all four of them, Lance, his mom, and his two younger brothers, Connor and Thad. Connor was only six and believed in Santa Claus. Lance and Thad no longer had that option. At home, decorating the tree was a joyous occasion with laughter and joking around and plenty of popcorn and homemade cookies. Here, although it was a solitary chore, it was preferable to suffering through the agonies of Mrs. Stone&#x2019;s class.<br> <br>A few people besides Marvin had come and gone while Lance worked, so he didn&#x2019;t turn to look when the metal door clicked open behind him. Intent on having lost the wire hanger to one of the Christmas balls, he was staring into the tree branch, trying to find it, when he heard an unexpected hissing from the glue can he had left on the table with the other decorations. Just as quickly, he felt the cold in his legs as the aerosol spray hit, freezing his pant legs to his skin. Lance glanced down then. &#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; he demanded. &#x201c;What the hell do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;<br> <br>All he could see below him was a hand holding one of the spray cans of glue. Then a second hand came into his line of vision. It took a moment for his brain to register what he was seeing. The second hand held a cigarette lighter. Lance had time enough to register the flash of flame from the lighter, then the very air around him seemed to explode in flame. Writhing in pain, he attempted to lean over and pat out the fire on his legs. That was enough to tip the shaky ladder. The next thing Lance knew, he was falling and burning.<br> <br>Mercifully, for a long time after that, he remembered nothing.</p><h2>Sloth: A Dictionary for the Lazy</h2><p>The Seven Deadly Sins have sliced up the dictionary and taken what's theirs.

Yolen writes a most unusual ballad of pirate adventure that sings the history of Anne Bonney and Mary Reade, the only 2 women of the 12 pirates aboard the Vanity. They defend the ship from the men of the governor's man-o'-war, Albion, while their captain and the rest of the crew are below drinking rum and playing cards. The females are absolutely the best and bravest of this bad lot. The Vanity is taken; all are brought to trial, but Anne and Mary escape hanging by "pleading their bellies" (claiming they are pregnant), a page taken from history for which Yolen provides notes. Shannon's acrylics are rich, dark, and realistic, and expand upon the story. Faces glow as they did in his work for Rafe Martin's Rough-Face Girl (Putnam, 1992).

Contact with such momentous forces was never going to leave the proponents of liberal values unchanged. Zevin holds a mirror to the politics&#x2014;and personalities&#x2014;of <i>Economist</i> editors past and present, from Victorian banker-essayists James Wilson and Walter Bagehot to latter-day eminences Bill Emmott and Zanny Minton Beddoes.<br><br> Today, neither economic crisis at home nor permanent warfare abroad has dimmed the <i>Economist</i>&#x2019;s belief in unfettered markets, limited government, and a free hand for the West. Confidante to the powerful, emissary for the financial sector, portal onto international affairs, the bestselling newsweekly shapes the world its readers&#x2014;as well as everyone else&#x2014;inhabit. This is the first critical biography of one of the architects of a liberal world order now under increasing strain.</p><p><p><b>Alexander Zevin</b> is an Assistant Professor of History at City University of New York and an Editor at <i>New Left Review</i>.</p>&#x201c;A singular work of history whose great strength is in the originality of its conceit. By recounting the intellectual biography of a single publication, Zevin is able to show how the <i>Economist</i> has offered a near-unbroken record of the &#x2018;dominant stream&#x2019; of liberal thought. Drawing on a mass of archival research and interviews with former and current <i>Economist</i> staffers, the book is intellectually rich without being conceptually baggy. Masterful.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Gavin Jacobson, <i>New Statesman</i> (&#x201c;Books of the Year&#x201d;)</b><br><br> &#x201c;This is a great book, of considerable scholarship.

Zevin takes it at its word, telling the story not only of the magazine itself but also of its impact on world affairs. Having evidently mastered the magazine&#x2019;s archives, he commands a deep knowledge of its inner workings. The <i>Economist </i>emerges as a force that&#x2014;thanks to the military, cultural and economic power of Britain and, later, America&#x2014;can truly be said to have made the modern world, if not in the way that many liberals would suppose.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Pankaj Mishra, <i>New Yorker</i></b></p><h2>Economics of the Madhouse: Capitalism and the market today</h2><p>Page edges tanned.

From the hilarious opening anecdote about his 4-year-old's verbal attack on a waiter to his reassuring final chapter ("From Cookies to Car Keys"), Severe's candor, practical advice, and savvy long-term vision offer quick relief for overwhelmed parents of 3- to 6-year-olds. The moral of this school psychologist's story: Language counts; use it wisely. Yelling, spanking, and knee-jerk time-outs do little to correct misconduct, and may promote more misbehavior. Instead, Severe champions positive, age-appropriate phrases to curb the whining, parry the potty words, and morph fights into sharing sessions. He shows how to formulate meaningful consequences for little rule breakers and how to wield the parents' ultimate "better behavior" tool: consistency. Literally hundreds of clever catch phrases (void of the word <i>don't</i>), sample dialogues, anger-management techniques, written exercises, and tips on tweaking inadequate corrective measures flow throughout Severe's 25 standalone chapters. An ample book list that offers suggested parent/child reading on dozens of topics nicely caps off this exemplary guide. <i>--Liane Emory Thomas</i>This book will teach you how to teach your children to behave, how to listen-- the first time, and how to be more cooperative. It shows you how to be consistent and manage your anger. It explains how to prevent arguments and power struggles. This book will make discipline simple and your life easier. You will learn how to enjoy being a parent. <p>In the past fourteen years, Dr. Severe has traded ideas with more than 12,000 parents who have attended his workshops.

Mann and Norman J. Ornstein, but now it is a broken branch, damaged by partisan bickering and internal rancor. <em>The Broken Branch</em> offers both a brilliant diagnosis of the cause of Congressional decline and a much-needed blueprint for change, from two experts who understand politics and revere our institutions, but believe that Congress has become deeply dysfunctional. <br> Mann and Ornstein, two of the nations most renowned and judicious scholars of government and politics, bring to light the historical roots of Congress's current maladies, examining 40 years of uninterrupted Democratic control of the House and the stunning midterm election victory of 1994 that propelled Republicans into the majority in both House and Senate. The byproduct of that long and grueling but ultimately successful Republican campaign, the authors reveal, was a weakened institution bitterly divided between the parties. They highlight the dramatic shift in Congress from a highly decentralized, committee-based institution into a much more regimented one in which party increasingly trumps committee. The resultant changes in the policy process--the demise of regular order, the decline of deliberation, and the weakening of our system of checks and balances--have all compromised the role of Congress in the American Constitutional system. Indeed, Speaker Dennis Hastert has unabashedly stated that his primary responsibility is to pass the president's legislative program--identifying himself more as a lieutenant of the president than a steward of the house. From tax cuts to the war against Saddam Hussein to a Medicare prescription drug benefit, the legislative process has been bent to serve immediate presidential interests and have often resulted in poorly crafted and stealthily passed laws. Strong majority leadership in Congress, the authors conclude, led not to a vigorous exertion of congressional authority but to a general passivity in the face of executive power. <br> A vivid portrait of an institution that has fallen far from the aspirations of our Founding Fathers, <em>The Broken Branch</em> highlights the costs of a malfunctioning Congress to national policymaking, and outlines what must be done to repair the damage.</p><p><br><strong>Thomas E. Mann</strong> is the W. Averell Harriman Chair and Senior Fellow in Governance Studies at The Brookings Institution. The author of numerous books on American government, and a contributor to major magazines and newspapers like <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>New York Times</em>, he is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Mann has served as co-director (with Ornstein) of the Transition to Governing Project and senior counselor (with Ornstein) to the Continuity of Government Commission. He lives in Bethesda, Maryland.<br> <strong>Norman J. Ornstein</strong> is a Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research. An election analyst for CBS News, he writes a weekly column called "Congress Inside Out" for <em>Roll Call</em>. His work has also appeared in <em>The New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal</em>, and <em>Foreign Affairs</em>, and he appears regularly on television programs like <em>The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, Nightline</em>, and <em>Charlie Rose</em>. He serves on the board of the Public Broadcasting Service and several other nonprofit groups. Like Mann, he is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland.<br>Citizens baffled by the House of Representatives' allocation of its time in July -- spent mostly on flag burning, stem-cell research, gay marriage, the Pledge of Allegiance, religion and gun control -- can find cogent explanations for its political priorities in this slim, forceful volume. Not that the subjects that ate up the House calendar last month are addressed here; they are not. It is the institution of Congress that Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein dissect, and they find it in appalling condition. <p>The authors are members of what, sadly, may be a disappearing breed in Washington: independent-minded, knowledgeable experts whose concern for process is stronger than their desires for particular outcomes. They are means guys in an age dominated by ends. And they most emphatically do not believe that any particular end justifies craven or extra-legal means.</p><p>Mann and Ornstein are Washington fixtures, Mann at the Brookings Institution and Ornstein at the American Enterprise Institute. You've seen them both on television and quoted countless times; they are the sort of pundits that reporters rely on. They have been friends, sometimes rivalrous ones, since graduate school; they studied together at the University of Michigan and were congressional fellows together in 1969. Their personal politics are left-of-center, but, as they declare at the beginning of the book, their strongest partisanship is institutional. "For us," they write, "Congress has always been the first branch." Their devotion to Congress has won them admirers from all points on the political spectrum. A blurb from former Republican speaker of the House Newt Gingrich makes the point: "Mann and Ornstein understand well the glaring gap between the framers' design and today's reality." </p><p>The Founding Fathers quite deliberately described Congress in the first article of the Constitution, the presidency in the second. The authors of a revolution designed to overthrow a monarch did not want to put a comparably powerful chief executive officer in the king's place. Congress, explicitly granted the power to raise and spend money, was to have the upper hand.</p><p>Over more than two centuries of American history, the founders' intention to create a strong legislature has repeatedly been tested -- and sometimes evaded, as in recent years. Until now, the pendulum has always swung back toward the Capitol after periods of unusually strong White House influence. Mann and Ornstein fervently want this to happen again; their book explains why they consider this so important and provides some ideas for how it might happen. But fundamental change will not come from tinkering reforms, they argue; only angry voters can force the House and Senate to correct themselves.</p><p>Their account of the recent decline of Congress, and particularly the House, is scathing but difficult to dispute. They blame a poisonously partisan division in both houses and in the country for much of today's congressional bickering and irrelevance. Partisan warfare led Republicans to cater to "the base," the country's most conservative Republicans, which explains the House's bizarre agenda in July. Mann and Ornstein trace the origins of partisan warfare back to the 1980s, when a contemptuous Democratic majority dominated the House without any fear or expectation that the Republicans would ever regain control. But Gingrich's forces did, of course, leading first to the spectacle of a wholly partisan impeachment of a sitting president and then to the first period of extended GOP control of both Congress and the White House since the 1920s.</p><p> "The arrival of unified Republican government in 2001 transformed the aggressive and active GOP-led Congress of the Clinton years into a deferential and supine body, one extremely reluctant to demand information, scrub presidential proposals, or oversee the executive," Mann and Ornstein write. "The uncompromising assertion of executive authority by President Bush and Vice President Cheney was met with a whimper, not a principled fight, by the Republican Congress." The authors write contemptuously of House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and his willingness to ignore House rules and traditions to ram through legislation to please the White House.</p><p>History is often ignored or forgotten in contemporary America, but not by Mann and Ornstein. Their argument is strengthened by their ability to put it in historical context, to demonstrate how far the current Congress has wandered from the legislature's traditional and constitutional role. Unfortunately, Mann and Ornstein let their own history complicate their narrative by repeatedly quoting their earlier writings. Their editor did them no favor by permitting these self-citations, which create a "We told you so" tone not conducive to making, or winning, an argument.</p><p>Even so, it is easy to recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Congress, how it works and how it should work. Hastert would be particularly well-served by spending a few hours with The Broken Branch. And if, as Mann recently predicted in The Post's Outlook section, Democrats win control of the House in November, this book will suddenly be useful to both parties: to the Democrats as a cautionary tale and a useful blueprint, to the Republicans as an insight into where they went wrong. </p><p>Reviewed by Robert G.

When pushed for examples, many point to the early chapters of Genesis as proof&#x2014;creation, the Flood, 900-year life spans. And science has largely been silent on the subject&#x2014;until now. Examining recent, leading-edge scientific discoveries, Dr. Hugh Ross explores how these very chapters hold some of the strongest scientific evidence for the Bible&#x2019;s supernatural accuracy. Like never before, The Genesis Question integrates the accuracy of both science and the Bible&#x2014;without compromise&#x2014;giving skeptics and believers common ground and opportunity for dialogue.</p><p>DR. HUGH ROSS earned his B.S. in physics from the University of British Columbia and his M.S. and Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Toronto. He is the founder and president of Reasons to Believe, and hosts a television series by the same name which is broadcast internationally on TBN. A highly requested speaker on the topics of faith and science, Dr. Ross has appeared on numerous radio and television programs, including &#34;CBS Television News,&#34; &#34;Praise the Lord,&#34; &#34;The 700 Club,&#34; and &#34;Focus on the Family.&#34; He is the author of three other NavPress books: The Creator And The Cosmos, Creation And Time, and Beyond The Cosmos. Dr. Ross and his family live in southern California.Ross, a "creationist," directs the efforts of Reasons to Believe, an institute dedicated to proclaiming and proving the factual character of events recorded in the Bible. In his latest work, he demonstrates that Genesis 1-11, a series of chapters that many biblical critics contend are stories that can't be verified historically or scientifically, contains some of the strongest evidence of the Bible's supernatural accuracy. He asserts that if the miracles of creation and the flood in Genesis can be validated, this will indicate the reality of scientifically non-testable miracles like the Virgin Birth and the resurrection of Lazarus. Ross argues that a literal reading of these early chapters in Genesis accords perfectly with the established scientific record. For example, he contends that God creates material and spiritual substance out of nothing. This nothingness, he notes, corresponds to the definition of physicists who claim that "nothing" is the lack of matter, energy and all 10 theoretical space-time dimensions of the universe, as proposed by mathematics. Thus, he says, God's creative activity can be substantiated by physical science. Ross has a faithful following who will welcome this book. Others may wonder why he is trying so hard to turn faith into science. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Dark Tower and Other Stories</h2><p>A collection of Lewis&#x2019;s complete shorter fiction, including two previously unpublished works, &#x201c;The Dark Tower&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Man Born Blind.&#x201d; Edited and with a Preface by Walter Hooper.<br></p><p>"Lewis's words appear often in my Mitford stories.

Safe for them, that is. The only problem was that he still <i>needed</i> them, needed the sound of human voices and laughter. To his shame, he sometimes hovered on the edge of one of the campgrounds just to listen to the voices and pretend they were talking to him.</p><p>Which was a very small part of the reason that he was lying belly-down in the kinnikinnick and old tamarack needles in the shadow of a stand of trees, watching the young man who was writing with a pencil in a metal-bound notebook after taking a sample of the bear scat and storing the resultant partially filled plastic bag in his backpack.</p><p>Walter had no fear the boy would see him: Uncle Sam had ensured that Walter could hide and track, and decades of living alone in some of the most forbidding wilderness in the States had made him into a fair imitation of those miraculously invisible Indians who had populated the favorite books and movies of his childhood. If he didn&#x2019;t want to be seen, he wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;besides, the boy had all the woodcraft of a suburban housewife. They shouldn&#x2019;t have sent him into grizzly country on his own&#x2014;feeding grad students to the bears wasn&#x2019;t a good idea, might give them ideas.</p><p>Not that the bears were out today. Like Walter, they knew how to read the signs: sometime in the next four or five hours there was a big storm coming. He could feel it in his bones, and the stranger didn&#x2019;t have a big enough pack to be prepared for it. It was early for a winter storm, but this country was like that. He&#x2019;d seen it snow in August.</p><p>That storm was the other reason he was following the boy. The storm and what to do about it&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t often anymore that he was so torn by indecision.</p><p>He could let the kid go. The storm would come and steal away his life, but that was the way of the mountain, of the wilderness. It was a clean death. If only the grad student weren&#x2019;t so young. A lifetime ago he&#x2019;d seen so many boys die&#x2014;you&#x2019;d think he&#x2019;d have gotten used to it. Instead, one more seemed like one too many.</p><p>He could warn the boy. But everything in him rebelled at the thought. It had been too long since he&#x2019;d spoken face-to-face with anyone . . . even the thought made his breath freeze up.</p><p>It was too dangerous. Might cause another flashback&#x2014;he hadn&#x2019;t had one in a while&#x2014;but they crept up unexpectedly. It would be too bad if he tried to warn the boy and ended up killing him instead.</p><p>No. He couldn&#x2019;t risk the little peace he had by warning the stranger&#x2014;but he couldn&#x2019;t just let him die, either.</p><p>Frustrated, he&#x2019;d been following for a few hours as the boy blundered, oblivious, farther and farther from the nearest road and safety. The bedroll on his backpack made it clear he was planning on staying the night&#x2014;which ought to mean he thought he knew what he was doing in the woods. Unfortunately, it had become clearer and clearer it was a false confidence. It was like watching June Cleaver roughing it. Sad. Just sad.</p><p>Like watching the newbies coming into &#x2019;Nam all starched and ready to be men, when everyone knew that all they were was cannon fodder.</p><p>Damn boy was stirring up all sorts of things Walter liked to keep away. But the irritation wasn&#x2019;t strong enough to make a difference to Walter&#x2019;s conscience. Six miles, as near as he figured it, he&#x2019;d trailed the boy, unable to make up his mind: his preoccupation kept him from sensing the danger until the boy student stopped dead in the middle of the trail.</p><p>The thick brush between them only allowed him to see the top of the boy&#x2019;s backpack, and whatever stopped the boy was shorter. The good part was that it wasn&#x2019;t a moose. You could reason with a black bear&#x2014;even a grizzly if it wasn&#x2019;t hungry (which in his experience was seldom the case), but a moose was . . .</p><p>Walter drew his big knife, though he wasn&#x2019;t sure he&#x2019;d try to help the boy. Even a black bear was a quicker death than the storm would be&#x2014;if bloodier. And he knew the bear around here, which was more than he could say about the boy. He moved slowly through the brush, making no noise though fallen aspen leaves littered the ground. When he didn&#x2019;t want to make noise, he didn&#x2019;t make noise.</p><p>A low growl caused a shiver of fear to slice through him, sending his adrenaline into the ozone layer. It wasn&#x2019;t a sound he&#x2019;d ever heard here, and he knew every predator that lived in his territory.</p><p>Four feet farther and he had nothing impairing his view.</p><p>There in the middle of the path stood a dog&#x2014;or something doglike, anyway. At first he thought it was a German shepherd because of the coloring, but there was something wrong with the joints of its front end that made it look more like a bear than a dog. And it was bigger than any damned dog or wolf he&#x2019;d ever seen. It had cold eyes, killer&#x2019;s eyes, and impossibly long teeth.</p><p>Walter might not know what to call it, but he knew what it was. In that beast&#x2019;s face lurked every nightmare image that haunted his life. It was the thing he fought through two tours of &#x2019;Nam and every night since: death. This was a battle for a blooded warrior, battered and tainted as he was, not an innocent.</p><p>He broke cover with a wild whoop designed to attract attention and sprinted, ignoring the protest of knees grown too old for battle. It had been a long time since his last fight, but he had never forgotten the feeling of the blood pounding through his veins.</p><p>&#x201c;Run, kid,&#x201d; he said as he blazed past the boy with a fierce grin, prepared to engage the enemy.</p><p>The animal might run. It had taken its time sizing up the boy, and sometimes, when a predator&#x2019;s meal charges it, the predator will leave. But somehow he didn&#x2019;t think that this beast was such an animal&#x2014;there was an eerie intelligence in its blindingly gold eyes.</p><p>Whatever had kept it from attacking the boy immediately, it had no qualms about Walter. It launched itself at him as if he were unarmed. Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t as smart as he thought&#x2014;or it had been deceived by his grizzled exterior and hadn&#x2019;t realized what an old veteran armed with a knife as long as his arm could do. Maybe it was aroused by the boy&#x2019;s flight&#x2014;he&#x2019;d taken Walter&#x2019;s advice at face value and was running like a track star&#x2014;and just viewed Walter as an obstacle to its desire for fresh, tender meat.</p><p>But Walter wasn&#x2019;t a helpless boy. He&#x2019;d gotten the knife from so...</p></p><h2>The Knitter&#39;s Life List: To Do, To Know, To Explore, To Make</h2><p>The Knitter&#39;s Life List is a richly illustrated road map to more than 1,000 must-have experiences guaranteed to get any knitter&#39;s needles clicking faster.

Now one of those secrets is about to come alive&#x2014;with a vengeance.<br><br>While trying to solve one of Florida&#x2019;s most profound secrets, Doc Ford is the target of a murder attempt by someone who wants to make it look like an accident. Or is the target actually Tomlinson? Whatever the answer, the liveaboards and fishing guides at Dinkin&#x2019;s Bay on Sanibel Island are becoming increasingly nervous&#x2014;and wary&#x2014;after a near-poisoning, a plane crash, and an explosion make it apparent that Ford and Tomlinson are dangerous companions.<br><br>What their small family of friends don&#x2019;t know is that their secret pasts make it impossible for the two of them to go to the law for help. There is an assassin on the loose, and it is up to them to find the killer&#x2014;before he (or she) finishes the job.</p><p>Randy Wayne White is the author of nineteen Doc Ford novels, the Hannah Smith novel Gone, and four collections of nonfiction. He lives on Sanibel Island, Florida, where he was a light-tackle fishing guide for many years.In Gone (2012), White introduced fishing guide Hannah Smith, hinting that she was interested in a relationship with marine biologist Doc Ford, the hero of White&#x2019;s acclaimed main series. Those hints almost come to fruition in the twentieth Ford novel, despite Ford&#x2019;s conviction that his other &#x201c;job,&#x201d; covert ops, won&#x2019;t mix with relationships. There are other roadblocks to romance, starting with a psycho convinced that Ford&#x2019;s opposition to &#x201c;jig-fishing&#x201d; for tarpon has cost him his shot at becoming a big-time documentarian. Then there&#x2019;s Ford&#x2019;s obsession with the disappearance of five U.S. Navy torpedo bombers in 1945, and finally, the presence on Ford&#x2019;s Sanibel Island home turf of a mysterious Brazilian who may also dabble in covert ops. Any of these plot strands might have made a novel in itself, and White has some trouble balancing them all. Still, for series fans, the overabundance of plot won&#x2019;t matter a whit. Call it a transitional episode with lots of distractions, if you must, but fans will still be riveted by Ford and Hannah&#x2019;s tango-like mating dance. And the climax is a corker, too. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Over his last several Doc Ford novels, White has vaulted to mainstream bestseller stauts. This one is likely to maintain the pattern. --Bill Ott</p><h2>Ephraim, Chosen of the Lord: What it means to be of the tribe of Ephraim</h2><p>This book is easy enough for a new Church member to understand and yet sufficiently challenging to fire the visionary imagination of the most devoted gospel scholar.

His body shakes with fever dreams, but his mind roams free as always, and he knows something is about to happen. Not in Tokyo; he will not see this thing himself. Something is about to happen in San Francisco.<br> &nbsp;<br> The mists make it easy to hide, if hiding is what you want, and even at the best of times reality there seems to shift. A gray man moves elegantly through the mists, leaving bodies in his wake, so that a tide of absences alerts Laney to his presence. A boy named Silencio does not speak, but flies through webs of cyber-information in search of the one object that has seized his imagination. And Rei Toi, the Japanese Idoru, continues her study of all things human. She herself is not human, not quite, but she&#x2019;s working on it. And in the mists of San Francisco, at this rare moment in history, who is to say what is or is not impossible...</p><p>Although Colin Laney (from Gibson's earlier novel <i>Idoru</i>) lives in a cardboard box, he has the power to change the world. Thanks to an experimental drug that he received during his youth, Colin can see "nodal points" in the vast streams of data that make up the worldwide computer network. Nodal points are rare but significant events in history that forever change society, even though they might not be recognizable as such when they occur. Colin isn't quite sure what's going to happen when society reaches this latest nodal point, but he knows it's going to be big. And he knows it's going to occur on the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, which has been home to a sort of SoHo-esque shantytown since an earthquake rendered it structurally unsound to carry traffic.<p> Colin sends Barry Rydell (last seen in Gibson's novel <i>Virtual Light</i>) to the bridge to find a mysterious killer who reveals himself only by his lack of presence on the Net. Barry is also entrusted with a strange package that seems to be the home of Rei Toi, the computer-generated "idol singer" who once tried to "marry" a human rock star (she's also from <i>Idoru</i>). Barry and Rei Toi are eventually joined by Barry's old girlfriend Chevette (from <i>Virtual Light</i>) and a young boy named Silencio who has an unnatural fascination with watches. Together this motley assortment of characters holds the key to stopping billionaire Cody Harwood from doing whatever it is that will make sure he still holds the reigns of power after the nodal point takes place.</p><p> Although <i>All Tomorrow's Parties</i> includes characters from two of Gibson's earlier novels, it's not a direct sequel to either. It's a stand-alone book that is possibly Gibson's best solo work since <i>Neuromancer</i>. In the past, Gibson has let his brilliant prose overwhelm what were often lackluster (or nonexistent) story lines, but this book has it all: a good story, electric writing, and a group of likable and believable characters who are out to save the world ... kind of. The ending is not quite as supercharged as the rest of the novel and so comes off a bit flat, but overall this is definitely a winner. <i>--Craig E.

Producing nearly two-thirds of all the munitions used by Allied forces, American industry became what President Franklin D. Roosevelt called "the arsenal of democracy." Crucial in this effort were business leaders. Some of these captains of industry went to Washington to coordinate the mobilization, while others led their companies to churn out weapons. In this way, the private sector won the war&#x2014;or so the story goes.</p><p>Based on new research in business and military archives, <i>Destructive Creation</i> shows that the enormous mobilization effort relied not only on the capacities of private companies but also on massive public investment and robust government regulation. This public-private partnership involved plenty of government-business cooperation, but it also generated antagonism in the American business community that had lasting repercussions for American politics. Many business leaders, still engaged in political battles against the New Deal, regarded the wartime government as an overreaching regulator and a threatening rival. In response, they mounted an aggressive campaign that touted the achievements of for-profit firms while dismissing the value of public-sector contributions. This probusiness story about mobilization was a political success, not just during the war, but afterward, as it shaped reconversion policy and the transformation of the American military-industrial complex.</p><p>Offering a groundbreaking account of the inner workings of the "arsenal of democracy," <i>Destructive Creation</i> also suggests how the struggle to define its heroes and villains has continued to shape economic and political development to the present day.</p></p><p>Mark R.

This was true even in times and places where guts were at a premium, as during the Allied invasion of Normandy, in June 1944. On D-Day and in the days that followed, American GIs and their British and Canadian counterparts were sometimes disappointed (and killed) by their own machines, too many of which sank below the waves, missed their targets, or otherwise failed to work as advertised. Even so, the soldiers preparing to land on the Normandy beaches could not help but be overawed&#x2014;and deafened&#x2014;by the firepower assembled to support them. In the skies just ahead, they saw hundreds of military aircraft, which, on the morning of 6 June alone, dropped thousands of high-explosive bombs. Behind them in the English Channel floated more than a hundred hulking warships, their big guns close to overheating from their constant shelling of German positions on the shore. Along with the naval vessels, the soldiers could also see a fleet of hundreds of cargo ships and landing craft, stretching to the horizon. These vessels, by the end of the two weeks starting with D-Day, would deliver to the Normandy beaches nearly 94,000 vehicles and over 245,000 tons of equipment and supplies, along with nearly 620,000 men. Here was the beginning of the end for the German armies, which, in the weeks to come, would be overwhelmed by the speed and power of Allied forces.</p><p>D-Day was truly an Allied operation, in which Britain (and Canada) provided much of the equipment and manpower. Yet even in a battle that took place just a hundred miles from England, one of the world's great industrial nations, it was obvious how much the Allied war effort depended on the economic output of the United States. The skies above Normandy buzzed with the bombers of the Eighth Air Force and Ninth Air Force: B-17 Flying Fortresses, B-24 Liberators, and B-26 Marauders (among other aircraft), made in Seattle, San Diego, and Baltimore. Many of the GIs who struggled ashore at Omaha Beach owed their lives to the sailors manning the five-inch guns of a whole group of the U.S. Navy's <i>Gleaves</i>-class destroyers, sitting in shallow waters just behind them. Those destroyers had been built during the early months of the war, in places such as Norfolk, Newark, and Seattle. At Omaha Beach and elsewhere, soldiers went ashore in small landing craft, built largely in New Orleans. Once they landed, the Allied armies relied on thousands of Sherman tanks, two-and-a-half-ton trucks, and jeeps, most of which were made in Toledo and Detroit. These tanks and trucks were disgorged by the score at Normandy by a fleet of some 230 tank landing ships (LSTs), the biggest of the Allied landing vessels, most of which were constructed in Pittsburgh, Chicago, and southern Indiana. And most of the fuel for the Army vehicles, along with most of the high-octane gasoline guzzled by Allied aircraft, came from the United States, as did most of the aluminum and steel used to make the planes, ships, tanks, and trucks.</p><p>Normandy was an exceptional military operation, but its reliance on American-made machines and mat�riel was part of a broader pattern of Allied war-fighting. During World War II, the United States helped vanquish the Axis powers by converting its enormous economic capacities into military power. By producing nearly two-thirds of all the munitions used by Allied forces&#x2014;including huge numbers of aircraft, ships, tanks, trucks, rifles, artillery shells, and bombs&#x2014;American industry became what President Franklin D. Roosevelt once called "the arsenal of democracy," providing the foundations for a decisive victory.</p><p>So the U.S. military-industrial mobilization for World War II worked well, or at least well enough. But how exactly did it work? How were all those bombers, ships, and planes produced, in such short order, under the pressures of a war emergency? And how was the mobilization related to broader, longer-run political and economic developments? What lessons should we take from its history? Seven decades after the end of World War II, we still lack good answers to these questions.</p><p>Since the 1940s, most accounts of the U.S. industrial mobilization for World War II have emphasized one of two stories. The first is a tale of the patriotic contributions of American business leaders and their companies. This account of the war contains a large element of truth. Private companies&#x2014;including those led by remarkable wartime entrepreneurs such as the shipbuilder Henry Kaiser, as well as large manufacturing corporations like General Motors&#x2014;did indeed shoulder the burden of munitions production. Many business leaders threw themselves into the work, with impressive results.</p><p>The second account tells a far more critical story about American business leaders. Indeed, it claims that big industrial corporations exploited the war emergency, to regain political power and reap economic gains. This story emphasizes the activities of corporate executives who went to Washington to run the war economy, in special civilian mobilization agencies such as the Office of Production Management and its successor, the War Production Board. Using their new foothold, so the story goes, the big corporations allied themselves with a conservative military establishment to thwart smaller firms, New Dealers, consumers, workers, and other citizens. According to this account, big business enjoyed huge wartime profits, thanks to an abundance of no-risk, cost-plus military contracts, which evidently prefigured the Cold War-era "military-industrial complex."</p><p>Despite their differences, these two accounts share a tendency to ignore, or disdain, the role of the public sector, including the work of the men and women who staffed powerful military and civilian governmental agencies. In the stories that celebrate the wartime achievements of American capitalism, the main characters are for-profit firms and their executives, some of whom took temporary jobs in government to help win the war. These same executives also figure prominently, albeit as villains, in the anticorporate version of events. That story is ultimately no less disparaging of civilian governmental and military authorities, because most of those public officials are presented as the handmaidens of big business.</p><p>This book shows that the military-industrial juggernaut of the early 1940s relied heavily on public investment, public management of industrial supply chains, and robust regulation. These powerful state actions shaped the dynamics of political struggle on the World War II home front. Wartime government-business relations were often antagonistic. Many business leaders regarded the wartime state as an annoyance: an imposing, overreaching regulator, as well as a threatening rival. They said so, openly, throughout the war. Their protests included aggressive, coordinated public-relations efforts, which played up the achievements of the private sector while dismissing the value of public contributions to the war economy. This pro-business framing effort was never uncontested, but it proved remarkably successful during World War II&#x2014;and long after.</p><p>This book builds on a third, loosely woven and overlooked set of studies, which have called attention to the importance of public finance, military administration, and government enterprise on the American home front. Drawing on new research in a great deal of previously underused evidence, including the archival records of leading military contractors and U.S. military bureaus, this book calls our attention to important but poorly remembered actors. Like many previous studies, this one includes characters such as William Knudsen, Donald Nelson, Henry Kaiser, and the War Production Board. But it also describes the work of less familiar individuals and agencies, such as the Army Air Forces' Materiel Command (based at Wright Field, in Ohio); military "price adjustment" boards; and plant seizure teams, led by career military officers such as Admiral Harold G. Bowen. It also considers a variety of important war contractors, including midsize and larger companies in several industries, along with some of the era's most politically active business executives. Many of the latter, including Frederick C. Crawford and J. Howard Pew, joined the ranks of top military contractors in the early 1940s, despite their deep distrust of the federal government.</p><p>Following the activities of this diverse cast of characters, this book weaves together two stories about "destructive creation." During the early part of World War II, the economist Joseph Schumpeter coined the phrase "creative destruction" to refer to the dynamism of capitalist economies, in which entrepreneurs created economic growth, even as they caused painful disruptions. Schumpeter did not use the phrase to refer specifically to the U.S. war mobilization, about which he knew little. But he presented it at a moment in which the U.S. economy was being transformed into a generator of devastating military power. Here was what might be called a "destructive creation," in which a giant capitalist economy was harnessed for the purpose of annihilating its enemies.</p><p>Successful conversion of the U.S. economy into an agent of "destructive creation" owed as much to socialism as it did to capitalism. To be sure, the American war economy relied on private-sector capacities, allowed for profits, and involved some competition among private firms. But it was also a war economy full of state enterprise and ramped-up regulation. The government paid for, and owned, acres of new industrial plant; it managed complex supply chains. It collected huge amounts of information about its contractors' costs and business operations, which helped it to strictly control prices and profits. It even seized the facilities of several dozen companies, including those led by executives who flouted federal labor law.</p><p>Remembering this public management and regulation of the industrial mobilization for World War II illuminates the history of modern conservative politics. Contrary to common belief, the war did not suspend politics as usual. In fact, the business community continued the energetic public-relations effort begun in the 1930s to counter the New Deal. During World War II, business leaders expanded that antistatist political effort, adjusting it to take account of new circumstances. As more and more firms and executives experienced the heavy hand of wartime state regulation, the business community and its political allies gained solidarity and strength. Executives from "big business" and the leaders of midsize and smaller firms, across many industries, joined together to resist government encroachment during wartime and&#x2014;perhaps more important&#x2014;to create a postwar future in which state enterprise and regulation would play a smaller part. Business leaders' political energy and unity, far from weakened by the stresses of war or patriotic duty, seem to have been bolstered by their common encounter with a formidable wartime state. This hardly made them all-powerful in the political arena but did leave them well positioned, after 1945, to continue to reverse the setbacks that they had experienced in the 1930s.</p><p>During and after the war, the business community was remarkably successful in framing the lessons of the military-industrial mobilization. According to business leaders, only for-profit enterprises made positive contributions to the production "miracle" of the early 1940s. This story, which was substantially destructive of the truth, contributed to a longer-running strain of American political discourse, which has disparaged governmental actors, condemned labor unions, and celebrated private enterprise. The history of the political struggles of the World War II era suggests the inadequacy of depictions of a static mid-twentieth-century liberal "consensus" or New Deal "order." Conservative business leaders in the 1940s saw themselves as engaged in a long war against excessive government regulation. From their point of view, the battle to frame the political lessons of the nation's economic mobilization for the biggest war in history seemed like a significant one, even if it might not offer any sort of immediate, wholesale triumph in the larger war.</p><p>Transformations in the military-industrial sector shaped American political and economic development. Starting in the 1940s, the American military economy swung toward privatization. By the mid-1960s, much of the government-controlled weapons production and design capacity, which had existed in the United States since the early nineteenth century, had been shed. This was no small achievement for the champions of free enterprise&#x2014;especially during the early Cold War, when the military accounted for the majority of all national governmental expenditures. The oft-discussed rise of deregulation and privatization that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s was preceded, and then accompanied, by an equally significant shift in the military-industrial field.</p><p>By the end of the twentieth century, many American leaders had accepted conservative myths about wartime industrial mobilization. Their own defense policies relied heavily on free markets and private contractors, while neglecting targeted public investment, state enterprise, and regulation of prices and profits. This policy orientation, which extended well beyond the defense sector, evidently allowed for plenty of technological innovation and economic growth. However, it is far from clear whether it has provided the United States, or the world, with optimal or even adequate solutions to many of the more pressing problems of the day. In the future, as some of those problems develop into more acute crises, there may be more interest in reviewing what we have learned from the history of the American response to the challenge of World War II. Such an exercise in lessons-learned history, should it be undertaken, may be unsettling, for it will be hard not to conclude that today's domestic and global political economy has been shaped by a misreading of the past.</p></p><h2>Composition &amp; Perspective: Lessons &amp; Exercises to Develop Your Painting &amp; Drawing Technique (Seeing Things Simply)</h2><p>A detailed and practical guide for beginners and experienced artists offers comprehensive advice on composing a successful picture and is accompanied by full-color instructions.</p><p></p><h2>Tonto Basin</h2><p>Written in 1921, this splendid novel existed for more than eighty years only in a profoundly censored version - To the Last Man - that undermined the truth of the characters and the authenticity of the story.

From his spirited defense of "fish tales" to his exploration of dozens of moments in a "fly-fishing addict's" life, this collection of fifty essays is sure to delight his legions of fans. <p>Nick Lyons takes a hard and often whimsical look at how we all learn to fish, what we fish for, and where we cast our lines. Bluegills, bluefish, snook, chub, brown trout, bass, and salmon are all explored, along with the discretely different experiences of fishing in small ponds, major Western rivers, English chalk streams, and no-name brooks. Lyons can be hilarious when recording his misadventures as a fishing guide or inventor of new flies, contemplative when looking at the ethics or peculiarities of fishing, nostalgic and philosophical about a season past or an old fishing friend now dead. In the emotions it explores and records, Confessions of a Fly Fishing Addict is Lyons's broadest book. </p><p>"Bravo for the Confessions, from one addict to another! Nick Lyons is quite simply the tops, in stylish prose, gentle wit, and accumulated wisdom. Add his sense of humility and complete honesty-rare qualities among us fly fishermen-and you will begin to understand why Lyons' essays are essential to our sanity."-William W. Warner, author of Beautiful Swimmers </p><p>"Confessions of a Fly Fishing Addict captures the feelings, frailties, frustrations, and fun of fly fishing. This is Nick Lyons at his absolute best. Nick Lyons weaves a spell with words as he masterfully makes us see ourselves more clearly on streams, lakes, estuaries, and oceans through his fly-fishing journeys. You won't put it down!"-Mark J. Sosin </p><p>Nick Lyons was for twenty-six years an English professor at Hunter College and is now a book publisher. He has published more than four hundred articles and eighteen books, most of them on fishing. Mari Lyons's paintings and drawings have graced previous books by her husband. She shows regularly at the First Street Gallery in New York City.</p>These essays, reprinted from Fly Fisherman magazine, form a smooth and satisfying collection. A book publisher and essayist, Lyons ( Bright Rivers ) is adept at both writing and fly fishing--qualities in evidence despite his humility and self-deprecating humor, which prompt a friend to chide him: "You're downgrading yourself too much, Nick. You're not nearly so bad a fisherman as you make out." His language sparkles ("What a glorious pool it is. The water sweeps down from a four-hundred-yard-long riffle, hits the bend, and makes marvelously trouty music"), and sound advice is leavened with wit and charm. To make a dry fly appeal to a fish, he counsels, have it behave naturally. "If you saw a piece of steak moving unnaturally on your plate, would you eat it?" The various pieces range in style from touching simplicity to slapstick comedy. Fly fishing, Lyons contends, is a panacea, "a pleasant, restful time, with the kind of happy, leisurely rhythms that are addictive." So are his essays. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Power, Money &amp; Sex: How Success Almost Ruined My Life</h2><p><p>Superstar Deion Sanders tells his powerful life story and reveals how power, money and sex could not satisfy the void in his life-a void ultimately satisfied by his relationship with Christ. A photo section included in this national best-seller.</p></p><p>It's a story as old as time, a nightmare as shocking as tomorrow's headlines: A talented young athlete rockets to fame and fortune, becoming the highest paid player in football history. But what he finds when he reaches the pinnacle of success is not the glory he had expected.<p>This is Deion's story, in his own words, with all the drama, hope, glamour, and surprise of his true-life adventures. For the first time ever, Deion tells the story of his rise to fame, his attempted suicide, and the shocking events that led him to faith in God and a new vision and purposes for his life.</p>Even in the world of athletic superstars, Sanders (aka "Neon Deion" and "Prime Time") is exceptional, supremely gifted in two sports: he is, for instance, the only man ever to hit a home run in the National League and score an NFL touchdown in the same week. His autobiography find a sympathetic audience not only among sports fans, however, but among conservative Christians who can't tell a punt from a bunt. Religion has played a large role in Sanders's life recently. He plans to enter the ministry after his sports career, and his faith has enabled him to express affection for his father, a drug addict who deserted the family when Sanders was seven and living in Fort Myers, Fla., and for his stepfather, an alcoholic. Readers may feel less inclined to forgive, but all will agree that his mother was a tower of strength. Sanders was a sports star in high school and college before turning pro. His success quickly brought the eponymous power, money and sex, but Deion found life empty, and his marriage a failure. He was saved?in the religious sense?by the efforts of two clergymen, including Bishop Jakes of Dallas, and now feels that his life is fulfilling. Sanders stumbles when expounding on his religious notions, which are sprinkled with awkward homilies ("the devil don't waste time offering you stuff you don't want"). They also reflect conservative principles that some readers won't share. It's Sanders's fast-paced account of his struggle to navigate the hazards of a life in the limelight, not his prosyletizing, that give this book the indelible stamp of Neon Deion. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Play It As It Lays</h2><p>A ruthless dissection of American life in the late 1960s, Joan Didion's <i>Play It as It Lays</i> captures the mood of an entire generation, the ennui of contemporary society reflected in spare prose that blisters and haunts the reader.

As seen in her two previous, highly acclaimed books-Restoration London and Dr. Johnson&#39;s London-she has immersed herself in contemporary sources of every kind. She begins with the River Thames, the lifeblood of Elizabethan London. The city, on the north bank of the river, was still largely confined within old Roman walls. Upriver at Westminster were the royal palaces, and between them and the crowded city the mansions of the great and the good commanded the river frontage. She shows us the interior d�cor of the rich and the not-so-rich, and what they were likely to be growing in their gardens. Then the Londoners of the time take the stage, in all their amazing finery. Plague, small-pox, and other diseases afflicted them. But food and drink, sex and marriage and family life provided comfort, a good education was always useful, and cares could be forgotten in a playhouse or the bear-baiting rings, or watching a good cockfight. Liza Picard&#39;s wonderfully skillful and vivid evocation of the London of four hundred years ago enables us to share the delights, as well as the horrors, of the everyday lives of sixteenth century Britain.</p><p><p>Praise for ELIZABETH'S LONDON:<br>"Wisely, she parcels out her findings in units that seldom come to more than one to three pages...there is an excellent index, a handy means of dealing with treasure that is piled high...You can open the book and start reading anywhere" --Richard Buell, Boston Globe<br>"Lively guide to Elizabethan England." -The Washington Post </p><p>Praise for DR.

It is not, author John Crewdson says, "about AIDS. Nor is it really about science." Indeed. It is a tale of behavior most base in circles most rarified.<p> In 1983 Gallo, of the National Cancer Institute, and a group of scientists at Paris's Pasteur Institute announced their isolating of separate AIDS viruses. The stakes--moneyed prizes and patents, not to mention cures--were stratospheric. By 1985, the Pasteur Institute filed suit claiming that Gallo--whose discovery was actually a dead end--had appropriated "their" virus as his own. In 1992, the National Academy of Sciences agreed, accusing Gallo of "intellectual recklessness" and "essentially immoral" behavior. </p><p> This definitive, chilling book is also, unfortunately, a daunting one. Its sheer size--notes, glossary, and list of characters alone occupy 100 pages--and scientific complexity will defeat all but the most determined and scientifically informed reader. <i>--H.

In many ways, those who seek Christ now differ little from those whose stories we learn in the Gospels: Peter, Nicodemus, Mary, the Samaritan leper, even Judas. Professor Simon J. Kistemaker has spent his professional life studying the words and actions of those who spent time with Jesus. In <i>The Conversations of Jesus</i> he offers a glimpse into the lives of those who were touched by encounters with Jesus Christ. Readers will find much in common with these first-century people, including their feelings of inadequacy, confusion, and joy at meeting the Savior. Ideal for laypersons and pastors, <i>The Conversations of Jesus</i> helps readers strengthen their walks with Christ as they learn about others who have walked this path before.</p><p>Listen in During his earthly ministry, Jesus encountered a wide variety of people, paying attention to each and every one. The Conversations of Jesus is an accessible yet in-depth portrayal of these key interactions, related with keen observations by acclaimed scholar Simon J. Kistemaker.

Copper Bottom and Steel Dust; that's where it all began," Hadley Crane said as he backed the trailer out of the parking lot at San Luis Sale Barn.</p> <p>" Yeah, like, I know exactly what you're talking about!" Lisa Goodman raised her eyebrows at Kirstie Scott. The reversing trailer raised a cloud of dust, which blew grit into the girls' eyes. It was late afternoon and the baking sun was sinking low in a clear blue sky.</p> <p>"Two sires," Hadley went on. The head wrangler at Half Moon Ranch positioned the trailer to wait in line at the wide exit onto Route 27. "Copper Bottom and Steel Dust started a specialist breed of horse way back in the 1930s."</p> <p>"What was special about them?" Kirstie could hear the three young horses they'd just bought stamping impatiently inside the metal trailer. She fanned her face with the sale program, then pulled down the peak of her baseball cap to shade her eyes. </p> <p>"Easy to keep. Good feet. Small. Fast." Tersely, Hadley listed the strong points of the breed of horse used by the ranchers in the West. "Mighty fast, as a matter of fact. You put a postage-stampsized saddle on one of those guys, set him on a sprint track around the outside of a rodeo arena, and he'd blast out of that starting gate like a bullet out of a gun."</p> <p>Kirstie grinned at Lisa. Get Hadley talking about his favorite subject, and there was no stopping him. The normally silent old ranch hand could ramble on for ages. "Isn't that why they're called quarter horses?" she asked, as their tall vehicle eased out onto the road.</p> <p>"Sure." He signaled left and followed the sign that read: Minesville 8 miles, Renegade 3 miles. "Those races were no more than a quarter of a mile long. The horse never drew breath the whole time he was sprinting. He slowed up over the finish line and realized he might be kinda short of breath out there. But there was nothing to beat him for a short burst of speed. Short horse, or quarter horse. And it's all because of Copper Bottom and Steel Dust."</p> <p>"Hmm." Lisa was impressed. She settled back in the passenger seat for the drive down the narrow, straight road to Renegade. "So the three horses we bought for Donna Rose back there, Skeeter, Moonpie, and Midnight Lady, they're all quarter horses?"</p> <p>Skeeter, the three-year-old black-and-white paint. Strangely named Moonpie, the flea-bitten gray with a rash of brownish markings. Long-limbed, dapple gray Midnight Lady. Kirstie held a picture of them in her mind, their nervousness in the sale barn arena, heads up, ears flicking this way and that in reaction to the unaccustomed noise and bustle.</p> <p>She recalled the paint's high-pitched whinny as Hadley led him up the ramp into the trailer, Moonpie following reluctantly where his more spirited leader had already gone. And the trouble they'd had loading Midnight Lady, who'd objected to the dark steel box and the echo of her hooves as they struck the metal ramp. She'd pulled and strained at the halter rope, until Hadley had switched tactics and offered her a handful of sweet alfalfa hay to tempt the hungry horse inside.</p></p><h2>Alva, That Vanderbilt-Belmont Woman</h2><p>Alva, That Vanderbilt-Belmont Woman.Copyright 1992 by Margaret Rector with 324 pages.</p><p></p><h2>Between Heaven and Hell: The Story of a Thousand Years of Artistic Life In Russia</h2><p>A prominent historian explores the unique culture of Russian art, investigating its social and political aspects, in a saga that spans Byzantine Christianity, the czarist splendor, the return of brutalized exiles to their homelands, and the artists that captured these moments. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>This slim volume tackles an overwhelming subject: 1,000 years of Russian achievements in the arts, from medieval ikons to the novels of Tolstoy to the films of Eisenstein. Much has been written about the subject over the years, but Lincoln poses himself a slightly different task: to depict not so much the history of Russian arts as the history of the country's "artistic experience," including the "social and political forces" that shaped artistic creation. Author of such histories as <i>Romanovs</i> and <i>Nicholas I</i>, Lincoln ably provides the context such a task requires. Unfortunately, Lincoln's purple prose can sometimes be distracting. No one ever seems to merely wear a medal, they wear it "proudly"; a building is not simply painted turquoise when it can be "brilliant" turquoise. Here, for instance, is Lincoln on the music of Rimsky-Korsakov: "Oceans churned, storms thundered, the sun sparkled in wintry forests, and in the new warmth of spring nightingales sang and golden fish leaped from crystal streams." Overall, however, Lincoln's marriage of history and the arts is a happy one, demonstrating how the peculiarly Russian tension between East and West and between politics and the arts helped produce artistic works that were both uniquely beautiful and uniquely Russian.W.

Believe it or not, the Good Book doesn't mention Friday, and even more surprisingly, while the Bible says Jesus rose from the grave, it does not say it occurred Sunday morning. Remember, Jesus' followers found an empty tomb then.</p><p>But don't feel bad if you've always assumed otherwise. Like countless millions of people, you've just been misinformed, misled or even (dare we say) lied to about what the Bible actually says.</p><p>In a stunning investigation, news veteran Joe Kovacs goes on a mission to help both Christians and non-Christians alike find out what the Bible really contains, and what it doesn't.</p><p>"Shocked by the Bible: The Most Astonishing Facts You've Never Been Told" is an educational juggernaut that relies solely on the Holy Bible to reveal hundreds of Scriptural facts that many people of all persuasions simply don't know.

"My goal is to educate people about the solid truth of Scripture and to stop the spread of erroneous information. I want people to crack open their Bibles and see with their own eyes what's actually printed on the pages, and what's not. It's shocking!"</p><p>According to Scripture, you won't find "Three Wise Men" mentioned anywhere in the story of Jesus' birth. For that matter, none are said to have shown up at the manger in Bethlehem. The truth straight from your own Bible is that an unspecified number of wise men first met Jesus as a "young child" in a "house," not a babe in a manger, and it might have been more than a year after He was born. Go ahead, look it up for yourself.</p><p>Also, according to Scripture, you won't find a single mention of Easter eggs, but you will find God warning His people not to have anything to do with a pagan fertility goddess, whose name is synonymous with "Easter."</p><p>"Yes, I'm a Bible-believing Christian," says Kovacs. "But I'm not here to convert anyone. People are free to believe whatever they wish and can come to their own conclusions. I just want to show them the biblical record is often very different from what many assume. Not only will Christians love this book, but I think Jews, Muslims and even agnostics and atheists will get a kick out of it as well."</p></p><p>Joe Kovacs is an acclaimed journalist who&#39;s spent 25 years in the broadcast, print, and online media, along the way receiving numerous awards for excellence in news coverage from both the Associated Press and United Press International.

This is the story of how Angela Carter invented herself - as a new kind of woman and a new kind of writer - and how she came to write such seductive and distinctive masterworks as <em>The Bloody Chamber, Nights at the</em> <em>Circus</em>, and <em>Wise Children</em>. Because its subject so powerfully embodied the spirit of the times, the book also provides a fresh perspective on Britain's social and cultural history in the second half of the twentieth century. It examines such topics as the 1960s counterculture, the social and imaginative conditions of the nuclear age, and the advent of second wave feminism.<br><br>Author Edmund Gordon has followed in Angela Carter's footsteps - travelling to the places she lived in Britain, Japan, and the USA - to uncover a life rich in adventure and incident. With unrestricted access to her manuscripts, letters, and journals, and informed by interviews with Carter's friends and family, Gordon offers an unrivalled portrait of one of the twentieth century's most dazzlingly original writers.<br><br>This sharply written narrative will be the definitive biography for years to come.<br></p><p><br><strong>Edmund Gordon</strong> studied philosophy at Trinity College Dublin and English literature at University College London, and since 2011 has been a lecturer in English at King's College London.

But when the plague catches up to the royal entourage, thwarting the King's plan for the princess to marry the Prince of Castile and seal an alliance between their kingdoms, Nell's life could change forever. Princess Joan's brother The Black Prince schemes to make the wedding go on declaring Nell will no longer double for Joan, she will become the princess and dupe Prince Pedro into marriage! With the aid and protection of a quirky band of friends&#x2014;a Spanish minstrel, a monk, a gravedigger, a band of merchants&#x2014;Nell must evade not only the Black Prince, a practitioner of the dark arts, but the plague as well, as she fights to return to the King and country. Based on historical truth, Dahme beautifully captures the dark terror of a Plague-infested fourteenth century Europe, while bringing to life the daily existence of medieval life for young adult readers.</p><p><b>Joanne Dahme</b> works for the Philadelphia Water Department as its Watersheds Programs Manager. She received her civil engineering degree from Villanova University in 1980, and went on to earn a Masters of Journalism and Master's in Creative Writing from Temple University. <i>Creepers</i>, her first venture into the realm of young adult fiction, met with widespread acclaim from the literary world. Joanne lives with her husband and son in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Grade 6&#x2013;10&#x2014;On the day Nell's parents are taken away by the gravediggers, her destiny changes because she bears an uncanny resemblance to Princess Joan, daughter of King Edward III. Worried that his military campaigns, as well as the burgeoning plague, could put his daughter in danger, the king decides that 15-year-old Nell should serve as his daughter's body double. As Nell and her brother George are traveling to Spain with the princess for her marriage, Joan's brother, known as the Black Prince, carries out a treasonous plan that leaves the princess dead in France and Nell forced to take her place in a phony marriage to the Prince of Castile. Realizing his treachery, Nell, George, and Henry, a soldier, try to escape the Black Prince. As they try to make their way through Bordeaux, they are joined by one cast of characters after another, and eventually find themselves in the clutches of the Black Prince once again. The three are taken back to England to be tried for treason, and they pray that King Edward will believe their story. The author's writing style is appealing, but the novel is largely plot driven and episodic with little character development. Additionally, the suggestion that the Black Prince has supernatural control over the plague-infested rats introduces a jarring element of fantasy in what is otherwise strictly historical fiction. The open-ended resolution leaves room for further adventures of Nell, George, and Henry, but readers will want stronger characters with whom they can develop a connection.&#x2014;<i>Cheri Dobbs, Detroit Country Day Middle School, Beverly Hills, MI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Korda writes with great elegance and flair.&#x201d;&#x2014;<em>Wall Street Journal</em> </p><p>From the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Ike </em>and <em>Horse People</em>, Michael Korda, comes <em>With Wings Like Eagles</em>, the harrowing story of The Battle of Britain, one of the most important battles of World War II. In the words of the <em>Washington Post Book World</em>, &#x201c;<em>With Wings Like Eagles</em> is a skillful, absorbing, often moving contribution to the popular understanding of one of the few episodes in history ... to deserve the description &#x2018;heroic.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>Michael Korda's brilliant work of history takes the reader back to the summer of 1940, when fewer than three thousand young fighter pilots of the Royal Air Force&#x2014;often no more than nine hundred on any given day&#x2014;stood between Hitler and the victory that seemed almost within his grasp.</p><p>Korda re-creates the intensity of combat in "the long, delirious, burning blue" of the sky above southern England, and at the same time&#x2014;perhaps for the first time&#x2014;traces the entire complex web of political, diplomatic, scientific, industrial, and human decisions during the 1930s that led inexorably to the world's first, greatest, and most decisive air battle. Korda deftly interweaves the critical strands of the story&#x2014;the invention of radar (the most important of Britain's military secrets); the developments by such visionary aircraft designers as R. J. Mitchell, Sidney Camm, and Willy Messerschmitt of the revolutionary, all-metal, high-speed monoplane fighters the British Spitfire and Hurricane and the German Bf 109; the rise of the theory of air bombing as the decisive weapon of modern warfare and the prevailing belief that "the bomber will always get through" (in the words of British prime minister Stanley Baldwin). As Nazi Germany rearmed swiftly after 1933, building up its bomber force, only one man, the central figure of Korda's book, Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding, the eccentric, infuriating, obstinate, difficult, and astonishingly foresighted creator and leader of RAF Fighter Command, did not believe that the bomber would always get through and was determined to provide Britain with a weapon few people wanted to believe was needed or even possible. Dowding persevered&#x2014;despite opposition, shortage of funding, and bureaucratic infighting&#x2014;to perfect the British fighter force just in time to meet and defeat the German onslaught. Korda brings to life the extraordinary men and women on both sides of the conflict, from such major historical figures as Winston Churchill, Neville Chamberlain, and Reichsmarschall Herman G�ring (and his disputatious and bitterly feuding generals) to the British and German pilots, the American airmen who joined the RAF just in time for the Battle of Britain, the young airwomen of the RAF, the ground crews who refueled and rearmed the fighters in the middle of heavy German raids, and such heroic figures as Douglas Bader, Josef Franti&#x161;ek, and the <em>Luftwaffe</em> aces Adolf Galland and his archrival Werner M�lders.</p><p>Winston Churchill memorably said about the Battle of Britain, "Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few." Here is the story of "the few," and how they prevailed against the odds, deprived Hitler of victory, and saved the world during three epic months in 1940.</p><p>Michael Korda is the author of <em>Ulysses S. Grant</em>, <em>Ike</em>, <em>Hero</em>, and <em>Charmed Lives</em>. Educated at Le Rosey in Switzerland and at Magdalen College, Oxford, he served in the Royal Air Force.

Even today, in both hardcover and paperback, his fiction remains extremely popular.<p>CHAPTER I</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For some reason the desert scene before Lucy Bostil awoke varying emotions&#x2014;a sweet gratitude for the fullness of her life there at the Ford, yet a haunting remorse that she could not be wholly content&#x2014;a vague loneliness of soul&#x2014;a thrill and a fear for the strangely calling future, glorious, unknown.</p> <p>She longed for something to happen. It might be terrible, so long as it was wonderful. This day, when Lucy had stolen away on a forbidden horse, she was eighteen years old. The thought of her mother, who had died long ago on their way into this wilderness, was the one drop of sadness in her joy. Lucy loved everybody at Bostil&#x2019;s Ford and everybody loved her. She loved all the horses except her father&#x2019;s favorite racer, that perverse devil of a horse, the great Sage King.</p> <p>Lucy was glowing and rapt with love for all she beheld from her lofty perch: the green-and-pink blossoming hamlet beneath her, set between the beauty of the gray sage expanse and the ghastliness of the barren heights; the swift Colorado sullenly thundering below in the abyss; the Indians in their bright colors, riding up the river trail; the eagle poised like a feather on the air, and a mile beneath him in the grazing cattle making black dots on the sage; the deep velvet azure of the sky; the golden lights on the bare peaks and the lilac veils in the far ravines; the silky rustle of a ca�on swallow as he shot downward in the sweep of the wind; the fragrance of cedar, the flowers of the spear-pointed mescal; the brooding silence, the beckoning range, the purple distance.</p> <p>Whatever it was Lucy longed for, whatever was whispered by the wind and written in the mystery of the waste of sage and stone, she wanted it to happen there at Bostil&#x2019;s Ford. She had no desire for civilization, she flouted the idea of marrying the rich rancher of Durango. Bostil&#x2019;s sister, that stern but lovable woman who had brought her up and taught her, would never persuade her to marry against her will. Lucy imagined herself like a wild horse&#x2014;free, proud, untamed, meant for the desert; and here she would live her life. The desert and her life seemed as one, yet in what did they resemble each other&#x2014;in what part of this scene could she read the nature of her future?</p> <p>Shudderingly she rejected the red, sullen, thundering river, with its swift, changeful, endless, contending strife&#x2014;for that was tragic. And she rejected the frowning mass of red rock, upreared, riven and split and ca�oned, so grim and aloof&#x2014;for that was barren. But she accepted the vast sloping valley of sage, rolling gray and soft and beautiful, down to the dim mountains and purple ramparts of the horizon. Lucy did not know what she yearned for, she did not know why the desert called to her, she did not know in what it resembled her spirit, but she did know that these three feelings were as one, deep in her heart. For ten years, every day of her life, she had watched this desert scene, and never had there been an hour that it was not different, yet the same. Ten years&#x2014;and she grew up watching, feeling&#x2014;till from the desert&#x2019;s thousand moods she assimilated its nature, loved her bonds, and could never have been happy away from the open, the color, the freedom, the wildness. On this birthday, when those who loved her said she had become her own mistress, she acknowledged the claim of the desert forever. And she experienced a deep, rich, strange happiness.</p> <p>Hers always then the mutable and immutable desert, the leagues and leagues of slope and sage and rolling ridge, the great ca�ons and the giant cliffs, the dark river with its mystic thunder of waters, the pine-fringed plateaus, the endless stretch of horizon, with its lofty, isolated, noble monuments, and the bold ramparts with their beckoning beyond! Hers always the desert seasons: the shrill, icy blast, the intense cold, the steely skies, the fading snows; the gray old sage and the bleached grass under the pall of the spring sand-storms; the hot furnace breath of summer, with its magnificent cloud pageants in the sky, with the black tempests hanging here and there over the peaks, dark veils floating down and rainbows everywhere, and the lacy waterfalls upon the glistening cliffs and the thunder of the red floods; and the glorious golden autumn when it was always afternoon and time stood still! Hers always the rides in the open, with the sun at her back and the wind in her face! And hers surely, sooner or later, the nameless adventure which had its inception in the strange yearning of her heart and presaged its fulfillment somewhere down that trailless sage-slope she loved so well!</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Bostil&#x2019;s house was a crude but picturesque structure of red stone and white clay and bleached cottonwoods, and it stood at the outskirts of the cluster of green-inclosed cabins which composed the hamlet. Bostil was wont to say that in all the world there could hardly be a grander view than the outlook down that gray sea of rolling sage, down to the black-fringed plateaus and the wild, blue-rimmed and gold-spired horizon.</p> <p>One morning in early spring, as was Bostil&#x2019;s custom, he ordered the racers to be brought from the corrals and turned loose on the slope. He loved to sit there and watch his horses graze, but ever he saw that the riders were close at hand, and that the horses did not get out on the slope of sage. He sat back and gloried in the sight. He owned bands of mustangs; nearby was a field of them, fine and mettlesome and racy; yet Bostil had eyes only for the blooded favorites. Strange it was that not one of these was a mustang or a broken wild horse, for many of the riders&#x2019; best mounts had been captured by them or the Indians. And it was Bostil&#x2019;s supreme ambition to own a great wild stallion. There was Plume, a superb mare that got her name from the way her mane swept in the wind when she was on the run; and there was Two Face, like a coquette, sleek and glossy and cunning; and the huge, rangy bay, Dusty Ben; and the black stallion Sarchedon; and lastly Sage King, the color of the upland sage, a racer in build, a horse splendid and proud and beautiful.</p> <p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Lucy?&#x201d; presently asked Bostil.</p> <p>As he divided his love, so he divided his anxiety.</p> <p>Some rider had seen Lucy riding off, with her golden hair flying in the wind. This was an old story.</p> <p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s up on Buckles?&#x201d; Bostil queried, turning sharply to the speaker.</p> <p>&#x201c;Reckon so,&#x201d; was the calm reply.</p> <p>Bostil swore. He did not have a rider who could equal him in profanity.</p> <p>&#x201c;Farlane, you&#x2019;d orders. Lucy&#x2019;s not to ride them hosses, least of all Buckles. He ain&#x2019;t safe even for a man.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Wal, he&#x2019;s safe fer Lucy.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But didn&#x2019;t I say no?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Boss, it&#x2019;s likely you did, fer you talk a lot,&#x201d; replied Farlane. &#x201c;Lucy pulled my hat down over my eyes&#x2014;told me to go to thunder&#x2014;an&#x2019; then, zip! She an&#x2019; Buckles were dustin&#x2019; it fer the sage.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s got to keep out of the sage,&#x201d; growled Bostil. &#x201c;It ain&#x2019;t safe for her out there.&#x2026; Where&#x2019;s my glass? I want to take a look at the slope. Where&#x2019;s my glass?&#x201d;</p> <p>The glass could not be found.</p> <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s makin&#x2019; them dust-clouds on the sage? Antelope?&#x2026; Holley, you used to have eyes better&#x2019;n me. Use them, will you?&#x201d;</p> <p>A gray-haired, hawk-eyed rider, lean and worn, approached with clinking spurs.</p> <p>&#x201c;Down in there,&#x201d; said Bostil, pointing.</p> <p>&#x201c;Thet&#x2019;s a bunch of hosses,&#x201d; replied Holley.</p> <p>&#x201c;Wild hosses?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I take &#x2019;em so, seein&#x2019; how they throw thet dust.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Huh! I don&#x2019;t like it. Lucy oughtn&#x2019;t be ridin&#x2019; round alone.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Wal, boss, who could catch her up on Buckles? Lucy can ride. An&#x2019; there&#x2019;s the King an&#x2019; Sarch right under your nose&#x2014;the only hosses on the sage thet could outrun Buckles.&#x201d;</p> <p>Farlane knew how to mollify his master and long habit had made him proficient. Bostil&#x2019;s eyes flashed. He was proud of Lucy&#x2019;s power over a horse. The story Bostil first told to any stranger happening by the Ford was how Lucy had been born during a wild ride&#x2014;almost, as it were, on the back of a horse. That, at least, was her fame, and the riders swore she was a worthy daughter of such a mother. Then, as Farlane well knew, a quick road to Bostil&#x2019;s good will was to praise one of his favorites.</p> <p>&#x201c;Reckon you spoke sense for once, Farlane,&#x201d; replied Bostil, with relief. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t thinkin&#x2019; so much of danger for Lucy.&#x2026; But she lets that half-witted Creech go with her.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, boss, you&#x2019;re wrong,&#x201d; put in Holley, earnestly. &#x201c;I know the girl. She has no use fer Joel. But he jest runs after her.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;An&#x2019; he&#x2019;s harmless,&#x201d; added Farlane.</p> <p>&#x201c;We ain&#x2019;t agreed,&#x201d; rejoined Bostil, quickly. &#x201c;What do you say, Holley?&#x201d;</p> <p>The old rider looked thoughtful and did not speak for long.</p> <p>&#x201c;Wal, yes an&#x2019; no,&#x201d; he answered, finally. &#x201c;I reckon Lucy could make a man out of Joel. But she doesn&#x2019;t care fer him, an&#x2019; thet settles thet.&#x2026; An&#x2019; maybe Joel&#x2019;s leanin&#x2019; toward the bad.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If she meets him again I&#x2019;ll rope her in the house,&#x201d; declared Bostil.</p> <p>Another clear-eyed rider drew Bostil&#x2019;s attention from the gray waste of rolling sage.</p> <p>&#x201c;Bostil, look! Look at the King! He&#x2019;s watchin&#x2019; fer somethin&#x2019;.&#x2026; An&#x2019; so&#x2019;s Sarch.&#x201d;</p> <p>The two horses named were facing a ridge some few hundred yards distant, and their heads were aloft and ears straight forward. Sage King whistled shrilly and Sarchedon began to prance.</p> <p>&#x201c;Boys, you&#x2019;d better drive them in,&#x201d; said Bostil. &#x201c;They&#x2019;d like nothin&#x2019; so well as gettin&#x2019; out on the sage.&#x2026; Hullo! What&#x2019;s thet shootin&#x2019; up behind the ridge?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No more&#x2019;n Buckles with Lucy makin&#x2019; him run some,&#x201d; replied Holley, with a dry laugh.</p> <p>&#x201c;If it ain&#x2019;t!&#x2026; Lord! Look at him come!&#x201d;</p> <p>Bostil&#x2019;s anger and anxiety might never have been. The light of the upland rider&#x2019;s joy shone in his keen gaze. The slope before him was open, and almost level, down to the ridge that had hidden the missing girl and horse. Buckles was running for the love of running, as the girl low down over his neck was riding for the love of riding. The Sage King whistled again, and shot off with graceful sweep to meet them; Sarchedon plunged after him; Two Face and Plume jealously trooped down, too, but Dusty Ben, after a toss of his head, went on grazing. The gray and the black met Buckles and could not turn in time to stay with him. A girl&#x2019;s gay scream pealed up the slope, and Buckles went lower and faster. Sarchedon was left behind. Then the gray King began to run as if before he had been loping. He was beautiful in action. This was play&#x2014;a game&#x2014;a race&#x2014;plainly dominated by the spirit of the girl. Lucy&#x2019;s hair was a bright stream of gold in the wind. She rode bareback. It seemed that she was hunched low over Buckles with her knees high on his back&#x2014;scarcely astride him at all. Yet her motion was one with the horse. Again that wild, gay scream pealed out&#x2014;call or laugh or challenge. Sage King, with a fleetness that made the eyes of Bostil and his riders glisten, took the lead, and then sheered off to slow down, while Buckles thundered past. Lucy was pulling him hard, and had him plunging to a halt, when the rider Holley ran out to grasp his bridle. Buckles was snorting and his ears were laid back. He pounded the ground and scattered the pebbles.</p> <p>&#x201c;No use, Lucy,&#x201d; said Bostil. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t beat the King at your own game, even with a runnin&#x2019; start.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lucy Bostil&#x2019;s eyes were blue, as keen as her father&#x2019;s, and now they flashed like his. She had a hand twisted in the horse&#x2019;s long mane, and as, lithe and supple, she slipped a knee across his broad back she shook a little gantleted fist at Bostil&#x2019;s gray racer.</p> <p>&#x201c;Sage King, I hate you!&#x201d; she called, as if the horse were human. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll beat you some day!&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Bostil swore by the gods his Sage King was the swiftest horse in all that wild upland country of wonderful horses. He swore the great gray could look back over his shoulder and run away from any broken horse known to the riders.</p> <p>Bostil himself was half horse, and the half of him that was human he divided between love of his fleet racers and his daughter Lucy. He had seen years of hard riding on that wild Utah border where, in those days, a horse meant all the world to a man. A lucky strike of grassy upland and good water south of the Rio Colorado made him rich in all that he cared to own. The Indians, yet unspoiled by white men, were friendly. Bostil built a boat at the Indian crossing of the Colorado and the place became known as Bostil&#x2019;s Ford. From time to time his personality and his reputation and his need brought horse-hunters, riders, sheep-herders, and men of pioneer spirit, as well as wandering desert travelers, to the Ford, and the lonely, isolated hamlet slowly grew. North of the river it was more than two hundred miles to the nearest little settlement, with only a few lonely ranches on the road; to the west were several villages, equally distant, but cut off for two months at a time by the raging Colorado, flooded by melting snow up in the mountains. Eastward from the Ford stretched a ghastly, broken, unknown desert of canons. Southward rolled the beautiful uplands, with valleys of sage and grass, and plateaus of pine and cedar, until this rich rolling gray and green range broke sharply on a purple horizon line of upflung rocky ramparts and walls and monuments, wild, dim, and mysterious.</p> <p>Bostil&#x2019;s cattle and horses were numberless, and many as were his riders, he always could use more. But most riders did not abide long with Bostil, first because some of them were of a wandering breed, wild-horse hunters themselves; and secondly, Bostil had two great faults: he seldom paid a rider in money, and he never permitted one to own a fleet horse. He wanted to own all the fast horses himself. And in those days every rider, especially a wild-horse hunter, loved his steed as part of himself. If there was a difference between Bostil and any rider of the sage, it was that, as he had more horses, so he had more love.</p> <p>Whenever Bostil could not get possession of a horse he coveted, either by purchase or trade, he invariably acquired a grievance toward the owner. This happened often, for riders were loath to part with their favorites. And he had made more than one enemy by his persistent nagging. It could not be said, however, that he sought to drive hard bargains. Bostil would pay any price asked for a horse.</p> <p>Across the Colorado, in a high, red-walled ca�on opening upon the river, lived a poor sheep-herder and horse-trader named Creech. This man owned a number of thoroughbreds, two of which he would not part with for all the gold in the uplands. These racers, Blue Roan and Peg, had been captured wild on the ranges by Ute Indians and broken to racing. They were still young and getting faster every year. Bostil wanted them because he coveted them and because he feared them. It would have been a terrible blow to him if any horse ever beat the gray. But Creech laughed at all offers and taunted Bostil with a boast that in another summer he would see a horse out in front of the King.</p> <p>To complicate matters and lead rivalry into hatred young Joel Creech, a great horseman, but worthless in the eyes of all save his father, had been heard to say that some day he would force a race between the King and Blue Roan. And that threat had been taken in various ways. It alienated Bostil beyond all hope of reconciliation. It made Lucy Bostil laugh and look sweetly mysterious. She had no enemies, and she liked everybody. It was even gossiped by the women of Bostil&#x2019;s Ford that she had more than liking for the idle Joel. But the husbands of these gossips said Lucy was only tender-hearted. Among the riders, when they sat around their lonely camp-fires, or lounged at the corrals of the Ford, there was specul...</p></p><h2>The 8-Hour Diet: Watch the Pounds Disappear Without Watching What You Eat!</h2><p><b>A paradigm-shifting diet plan that allows you to eat anything you want, as much as you want&#x2014;and still strip away 20, 40, 60 pounds, or more. </b><br><br>After conducting extensive research at the Salk Institute and the National Institute on Aging, poring over copious amounts of new research in intermittent fasting, and engaging 2,000 people for a test panel, bestselling authors David Zinczenko and Peter Moore determined that people can lose remarkable amounts of weight eating the foods they like best&#x2014;as long as they eat within a set 8-hour time period.

Now that NASA has put human space flight effectively on hold&#x2015;with a five- or possibly ten-year delay until the next launch of astronauts from U.S. soil&#x2015;Tyson&#x2019;s views on the future of space travel and America&#x2019;s role in that future are especially timely and urgent. This book represents the best of Tyson&#x2019;s commentary, including a candid new introductory essay on NASA and partisan politics, giving us an eye-opening manifesto on the importance of space exploration for America&#x2019;s economy, security, and morale. Thanks to Tyson&#x2019;s fresh voice and trademark humor, his insights are as delightful as they are provocative, on topics that range from the missteps that shaped our recent history of space travel to how aliens, if they existed, might go about finding <em>us</em>.</p><p><p><strong>Neil deGrasse Tyson</strong> is an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History, host of the hit radio and Emmy-nominated TV show <em>StarTalk</em>, and the <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author of <em>Astrophysics for People in a Hurry</em> and <em>Accessory to War: The Unspoken Alliance Between Astrophysics and the Military</em>. He lives in New York City.</p><p><strong>Avis Lang</strong> is a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History&#x2019;s Hayden Planetarium. For half a decade, she edited Tyson&#x2019;s <em>Natural History</em> magazine column, Universe, parts of which became the basis for his <em>Astrophysics for People in a Hurry</em>, and later edited his anthology <em>Space Chronicles</em>. She lives in New York City.</p>A mass-media force in science explication, Tyson appears in print (Parade, New York Times, Natural History), on television (The Colbert Report, PBS programs), in social networks like Twitter, and at podiums to deliver speeches. Taken from those forums, his declamations during the past 15 years on NASA and American space policy are gathered in this volume. Enthusiastic about the space program but worried by its current doldrums, Tyson speaks squarely to an audience that might question its expense. Repeatedly batting away the complaint that social problems don&#x2019;t justify spending money on space, Tyson perseveres by citing NASA&#x2019;s miniscule share of the federal budget, pointing to technological spin-offs, and invoking planetary defense against rogue asteroids. Perhaps sensing popular indifference to such arguments, Tyson more generally tries to revive wonder about space in his pieces, taking up in how-cool-is-that manner such things as Lagrange points and plucky little spacecraft like Pioneer 10 and the Mars rovers. A genial advocate for the space program, Tyson offers diagnoses of its malaise that will resonate with its supporters. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>Serendipity (Serendipity Books)</h2><p>A giant pink sea creature encounters careless fishermen and polluted seas as she follows a walrus and a dolphin to the Island of Capri to find out what kind of animal she is</p><p></p><h2>Chuck Yeager and the Bell X-1: Breaking the Sound Barrier</h2><p>Each year, millions of visitors flock to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum to look at the Bell X-1 aircraft-the vehicle in which Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier on October 14, 1947.

Fidelma and Eadulf are enjoying the feast when it is interrupted by the entrance of a religieux, who claims he has an important message for the King. He approaches the throne and shouts &#x2018;Remember Liamuin!' and then stabs King Colg�.

Determined to take a break from their crime-solving routine while enjoying some quality time with their young son, Fidelma and her husband-companion, Eadulf, are swept up into a mystery that hits uncomfortably close to home. After an assassination attempt is made on Fidelma&#x2019;s brother, Colgu, king of Muman, during a celebratory feast, Fidelma and Cashel are compelled to venture into enemy territory to uncover a motive for murder rooted in politics, unrequited love, and misplaced revenge. As usual, Fidelma utilizes a combination of psychology, spirituality, and observation to break the case and expose a treasonous conspiracy.

Intellectually bracing and grippingly written, it is the story of three experiments in linguistics, and is driven by a searching analysis of the nature of communication. Fiercely intelligent, energetic and challenging, it immediately established Watson as a writer of rare power and vision, and is now recognized as a modern classic.</p><p>Ian Watson was born in England in 1943 and graduated from Balliol College, Oxford, with a first class Honours degree in English Literature. He lectured in English in Tanzania (1965-1967) and Tokyo (1967-1970) before beginning to publish SF with &#34;Roof Garden Under Saturn&#34; for the influential New Worlds magazine in 1969. He became a full-time writer in 1976, following the success of his debut novel The Embedding. His work has been frequently shortlisted for the Hugo and Nebula Awards and he has won the BSFA Award twice. From 1990 to 1991 he worked full-time with Stanley Kubrick on story development for the movie A.I. Artificial Intelligence, directed after Kubrick&#39;s death by Steven Spielberg; for which he is acknowledged in the credits for Screen Story.

With Earth at its centre, the Intersolar Commonwealth now occupies a sphere of space approximately four hundred light years across. When an astronomer on the outermost world of Gralmond, observes a star 2000 light years distant - and then a neighbouring one - vanish, it is time for the Commonwealth to discover what happened to them. For what if their disappearance indicates some kind of galactic conflict? Since a conventional wormhole cannot be used to reach these vanished stars, for the first time humans need to build a faster-than-light starship, the Second Chance. But it arrives to find each &#39;vanished&#39; star encased in a giant force field -- and within one of them resides a massive alien civilisation.</p><p>Critics have compared the engrossing space operas of Peter F. Hamilton to the classic sagas of such sf giants as Isaac Asimov and Frank Herbert. But Hamilton's bestselling fiction--powered by a fearless imagination and world-class storytelling skills--has also earned him comparison to Tolstoy and Dickens. Hugely ambitious, wildly entertaining, philosophically stimulating: the novels of Peter F. Hamilton will change the way you think about science fiction. Now, with "Pandora's Star, he begins a new multivolume adventure, one that promises to be his most mind-blowing yet. <br>The year is 2380. The Intersolar Commonwealth, a sphere of stars some four hundred light-years in diameter, contains more than six hundred worlds, interconnected by a web of transport "tunnels" known as wormholes. At the farthest edge of the Commonwealth, astronomer Dudley Bose observes the impossible: Over one thousand light-years away, a star . . . vanishes. It does not go supernova. It does not collapse into a black hole. It simply "disappears. Since the location is too distant to reach by wormhole, a faster-than-light starship, the "Second Chance, is dispatched to learn what has occurred and whether it represents a threat. In command is Wilson Kime, a five-time rejuvenated ex-NASA pilot whose glory days are centuries behind him. <br>Opposed to the mission are the Guardians of Selfhood, a cult that believes the human race is being manipulated by an alien entity they call the Starflyer. Bradley Johansson, leader of the Guardians, warns of sabotage, fearing the Starflyer means to use the starship's mission for its own ends, . <br>Pursued by a Commonwealth special agent convinced the Guardians are crazy butdangerous, Johansson flees. But the danger is not averted. Aboard the "Second Chance, Kime wonders if his crew has been infiltrated. Soon enough, he will have other worries. A thousand light-years away, something truly incredible is waiting: a deadly discovery whose unleashing will threaten to destroy the Commonwealth . . . and humanity itself. <br>"Could it be that Johansson was right?<br> <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p>Peter F.

She was very old, though she did not know it, and she was no longer the careless color of sea foam but rather the color of snow falling on a moonlit night. But her eyes were still clear and unwearied, and she still moved like a shadow on the sea. </blockquote> <p> The unicorn discovers that she is the last unicorn in the world, and sets off to find the others. She meets Schmendrick the Magician--whose magic seldom works, and never as he intended--when he rescues her from Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival, where only some of the mythical beasts displayed are illusions. They are joined by Molly Grue, who believes in legends despite her experiences with a Robin Hood wannabe and his unmerry men. Ahead wait King Haggard and his Red Bull, who banished unicorns from the land.</p> <p> This is a book no fantasy reader should miss; Beagle argues brilliantly the need for magic in our lives and the folly of forgetting to dream. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>PETER S.

As a means of escaping the world around her, she enlists pen pals from around the globe who offer her a window on the hazards of adolescence in the Middle East, Europe, and America. With the aid of her letters, Brooks turns her bedroom into the bridge of the Starship Enterprise, the barricades of Parisian student protests, the swampy fields of an embattled kibbutz.<br><br>Brooks goes from the protected environment of a Catholic girls school to the University of Sydney, eventually renting her own flat near the bustling Sydney harbor. She hires on as an intern at <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> and then wins a scholarship to the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University in New York City, where she begins her career as a foreign correspondent.<br><br>As a writer for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, Brooks reports on wars and famines in the Middle East, Bosnia, and Africa, but she never forgets her earlier foreign correspondence. Back in Australia to attend her dying father, she stumbles on her old letters in her parents' basement, and embarks on a journey that tales her around the world on the most meaningful assignment of her career. Her search leads her through Israeli moshavim, Arab souks, medieval French hill towns, Martha's Vineyard fishing shacks, and Manhattan nightclubs. One by one, she finds men and women whose lives have been shaped by war and hatred, by fame and notoriety, and by the ravages of a mysterious and tragic mental illness. <br><br>It is only from the distance of foreign lands and against the background of alien lives that Brooks finally sees her homeland and her own life clearly. Candid, thoughtful, and compelling, <i>Foreign Correspondence</i> speaks to the unquiet heart of every girl who has ever yearned to become a woman of the world.</p><p>The leap between dreamy child living in a provincial Australian neighborhood and journalist hopscotching through war zones is massive. In <i>Foreign Correspondence</i>, Geraldine Brooks (<i>Nine Parts of Desire</i>) unravels the rope that pulled and tugged her toward adventure and away from "a very small world" where her family had no car and had never boarded a plane or placed an international phone call. "I'd never imagined myself as someone whose packing list would include a <i>chador</i>, much less a bulletproof vest," she says. Preserved in the cellar of her parents' home in Sydney were letters Brooks had received as a teenager from several international pen pals, around whom she spun a romantic view of the world. Wondering about the reality of their lives and the progression of her own, she tracks them down in France, Japan, the Middle East, and New York. En route, Brooks delivers a wonderful meditation on childhood and adolescence lashed with rich details and quirky humor. Speaking of a current pen pal, she notes: "Raed, from the West Bank, stoned my car in 1987; now he writes to tell me how he's faring in college.""There is real magic here. <i>Foreign Correspondence</i> is one of those books destined to be described as a gem. But gems are cold and inert and this book is alive and kicking with truth and wisdom about childhood, memory, and growing up. I still can't quite believe how good it is."--Michael Lewis, author of <i>Liar's Poker</i></p><h2>Hillbilly Women</h2><p>Interviews with Appalachian women in the 1970s</p><p>JENNIFER VAN DYCK has appeared on <i>Law &amp; Order</i>, the miniseries <i>Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis</i> (as Caroline Kennedy), and the movie <i>Bullets Over Broadway.</i></p><h2>Toddlers and Preschoolers: Love and Logic Parenting for Early Childhood, 6 Months to Five Years</h2><p>&#34;Has your sweet, innocent baby turned into a terrorizing toddler or pre-schooler?

He lives in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts.Battles, a contributor to Harper's and a Harvard librarian, offers a distinguished portrait of the library, its endurance and destruction throughout history, and traces how the library's meaning was questioned or altered according to the climate of the time. In accessible prose, Battles recounts the building and burning that have marked the library's long history. The Vatican Library built by Pope Nicholas V set the standard during the Renaissance, and the one built by the Jews in the Vilna ghetto during WWII showed the importance of books to a community under siege. Meanwhile, the mythic third-century B.C. book burnings by Chinese emperor Shi Huangdi were an effort to erase history, as was the catastrophic destruction of millions of books by the Nazis in the spring of 1933. Dynamic characters lend this history a novelistic tone: Julius Caesar began the library movement in Rome; Antonio Panizzi, an Italian revolutionary and exile, turned the library of the British Museum into one of the world's greatest in the 19th century; more recently, Nikola Koljevic, a scholar turned Serb nationalist, directed the siege of Sarajevo that led to a book burning at the Bosnian National and University Library. Battles also enlightens readers regarding the evolution of bookmaking, the card catalogue and the role of the librarian, including the most famous of all, Melvil Dewey, whose decimal system was only a small part of his influence. This always compelling history illustrates Battles's theme: despite the rule of barbarians or megalomaniacal kings, angry mobs and natural disasters, people's hunger for books has ensured the library's survival. 11 illus.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Missing Links</h2><p><i>Missing Links</i> is the story of four middle class buddies who live outside of Boston and for years have been 1) utterly obsessed with golf and 2) a regular foursome at Ponkaquoque Municipal Course and Deli, not so fondly known as Ponky, the single worst golf course in America. Just adjacent to these municipal links lies the Mayflower Country Club, the most exclusive private course in all of Boston and a major needle in their collective sides. Frustrated by the Mayflower's finely manicured greens and snooty members, three of Ponky's finest and most courageous--Two Down, Dannie, and Stick--set up a bet: $1,000.00 apiece, and the first man to somehow finagle his way on to the Mayflower course takes all. Lying, cheating, and forgery are encouraged, to put it mildly, and with the constant heckling and rare aid of Chunkin' Charlie, Hoover, and Bluto--a few more of Ponky's elite--the games begin.<br> One of the three will eventually play the Mayflower's course, but their friendships--and everything else--will change as various truths unravel and the old Ponky starts looking like the home they never should have left.<br><i>Missing Links</i> is a tremendously funny and fun-spirited novel about the smaller pleasures in life, and the perfect gift for anyone who is even remotely in love with the game of golf.</p><p>From <i>Sports Illustrated</i> writer Rick Reilly comes this spoof of all things golf and country club. <i>Missing Links</i> recounts the tale of a coterie of golfing friends who ply their hobby at Ponkoquogue Municipal Golf Links and Deli. An 18-hole garbage dump with hazards that include a concrete river surrounded by a chain-link fence and the pillars of the elevated train that runs through the course, it is reputed to be the worst golf course in America. One day the group inadvertently discovers that all along they've been playing right next door to the Mayflower Club, a true golfing Eden. The rollicking plot includes a bet to see who will be first to sneak in a round at the Mayflower, as well as the narrator's attempts to reach some sort of reasonable understanding with his overbearing father.Rick Reilly is senior writer for Sports Illustrated.</p><h2>The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud Vol.4: The Interpretation of Dreams (First Part)</h2><p><b>The Interpretation of Dreams Part I</b> (1900)<br><br>This collection of twenty-four volumes is the first full paperback publication of the standard edition of <i>The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud </i>in English</p><p></p><h2>Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals</h2><p>The celebrated author of The Book and the Brotherhood, as well as twenty-three other novels, investigates the themes that animate her fiction: the meaning of the good and its intimate relation to human experience. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>&#x201c;There are pages here that one wants to embrace her for, pages that say things of fundamental human importance in a way that they have never quite been said before.&#x201d; -- <i>Sunday Telegraph</i><b>Iris Murdoch</b>&nbsp;(1919&#x2013;1999) was born in Dublin and brought up in London.

Kennedy during the dramatic thousand days of the Kennedy presidency? Here for the first time is the full story of the extravagant interplay of sex and politics that constitutes one of modern history's most spectacular dramas.<br><br>Drawing from recently declassified top-secret material, as well as revelatory eyewitness accounts, Secret Service records, and Jacqueline Kennedy&#x2019;s personal letters, bestselling biographer Barbara Leaming answers the question: what was it like to be Mrs. John F. Kennedy during the dramatic thousand days of the Kennedy presidency? Brilliantly researched, Leaming&#x2019;s poignant and powerful chronicle illuminates the tumultuous day-to-day life of a woman who entered the White House at age thirty-one, seven years into a complex and troubled marriage, and left at thirty-four after her husband's assassination. Revealing the full story of the interplay of sex and politics in Washington, <i>Mrs. Kennedy</i> will indelibly challenge our vision of this fascinating woman, and bring a new perspective to her crucial role in the Kennedy presidency.</p><p>Barbara Leaming is the author of the critically acclaimed <i>Orson Welles</i> and the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Katharine Hepburn</i>. Her articles have appeared in <i>Vanity Fair</i> and <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>. She lives in Connecticut.<b>Author's Note</b><br><br>Had it not been for the fact that Jacqueline Kennedy was married to the President of the United States, it is unlikely that a single book about her would have been written. And yet, in the dozens of books about her, specific details of that presidency have been largely excluded. Even more striking, and of greater consequence, is the fact that the histories of John F. Kennedy's presidency are comparably flawed, missing as they do the story of Jacqueline Kennedy and her crucial role. In an effort to fill the gap, I have tried to tell her story in those years with as much attention to the presidency as to the events of her private life. The role of Jacqueline Kennedy is probably less understood than any other part of the Kennedy presidency; equally, her personal story cannot be grasped without seeing it in the context of the unfolding events of one of the twentieth century's most dramatic presidencies. Her life was changed by historical events in ways she had never anticipated. She, in turn, influenced certain of those events in ways that until now have remained largely unexamined.<br><br>The chronicle of any presidency is incomplete without a consideration of the president's private life. That is even more true in the case of John F. Kennedy, because his private life repeatedly put his presidency at risk. Oddly, Kennedy's detractors -- those seeking to portray his so-called dark side -- have largely excluded Jackie from their versions of events, every bit as much as his apologists have. I would argue that one can come to terms neither with Kennedy's darker aspects nor with his fundamental decency -- nor, ultimately, with what was perhaps his most stunning unfinished achievement, his own personal struggle against unimaginable odds for a moral compass -- without being intimately familiar with the unusual nature of his life with her.<br><br>What follows is Jacqueline Kennedy's story in the White House years told fully for the first time in the larger and inseparable context of the presidency. It is also, in important ways, the story of the Kennedy presidency, with a tremendous missing piece filled in. To view the presidency afresh, rather than start with published memoirs and established histories, I have reconstructed the story from scratch, using the vast documentation produced during the Kennedy administration: letters, memos, transcripts, reports, diaries, and other primary sources. Using Secret Service reports of presidential movements, appointment books, gate logs, and other records, I have tracked the President and First Lady, as well as their intimates and associates, on a day-by-day, often minute-by-minute basis. With the aid of transcripts and minutes of meetings, I listened to what was actually said, by Kennedy himself and by key participants, during the many tumultuous events that made this presidency such an exciting one. I followed the President afterward, whether upstairs to the family quarters or to the Kennedys' weekend retreat in the country, to see him unwind with his wife and close friends. I considered what certain of those friends had to say about the Kennedys, whether in letters or diaries of the period, or in interviews. And I listened carefully to Jackie's own voice, in letters and other documents.<br><br>No experience can have been more valuable to me than the opportunity to study Jackie's extraordinarily moving, uncharacteristically frank correspondence with Harold Macmillan, written after her husband's death. As I encountered the passionate, emotionally turbulent, unguarded voice in those letters, and made sense of the allusions, both hers and Macmillan's, to certain defining events in the presidency, I was struck by how little has ever really been known about Jacqueline Kennedy or her intimate life with Jack in the White House years. In telling that story, it is my hope that, as I did, the reader will come to a better and more sympathetic understanding of two flawed but good and remarkable people, both of whom, each in his or her own way, came to exemplify the virtue both valued most: courage.<br><br>Copyright � 2001 by Barbara Leaming</p><h2>Smile at Fear: Awakening the True Heart of Bravery</h2><p>Many of us, without even realizing it, are dominated by fear. We might be aware of some of our fears&#x2014;perhaps we are afraid of public speaking, financial hardship, or losing a loved one. But in this book meditation master Ch�gyam Trungpa shows us that most of us suffer from a far more pervasive form of fear: the fear of ourselves. We feel ashamed and embarrassed to look at our feelings or acknowledge our styles of thinking and behaving; we don&#x2019;t want to face the reality of our moment-to-moment experience. It is this fear that keeps us trapped in cycles of suffering, despair, and distress. <br><br>Ch�gyam Trungpa offers us a vision of moving beyond fear to discover the innate bravery, trust, and delight in life that lies at the core of our being. Drawing on the Shambhala tradition and on Buddhist teachings, he explains how we can each become a spiritual warrior: a person who faces each moment of life with openness and fearlessness. &#x201c;The ultimate definition of bravery is not being afraid of who you are,&#x201d; writes Ch�gyam Trungpa. <br><br>In language that is fresh, accessible, and startlingly direct, this book explains:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;how the practice of sitting meditation can help us to uncover our inherent confidence and bravery, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;how fear and embarrassment about ourselves keep us trapped in cycles of suffering, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;the wisdom of loving-kindness and nonaggression, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;how true invincibility depends on becoming more open and vulnerable.<br>Here are the essential insights and strategies that will allow us to finally claim victory over fear.</p><p>Ch�gyam Trungpa (1940&#x2013;1987)&#x2014;meditation master, teacher, and artist&#x2014;founded Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, the first Buddhist-inspired university in North America; the Shambhala Training program; and an international association of meditation centers known as Shambhala International. He is the author of numerous books including <i>Shambhala: Sacred Path of the Warrior</i>, <i>Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism</i>, and <i>The Myth of Freedom</i>.&#x201c;The teachings presented in this book are transformational&#x2014;and especially relevant today, when so many of us are facing uncertainty and anxiety.

The prose is simple, vivid, urgent quality from rhythm and sound and the cumulative effect of short sentences. It&#39;s also sprinkled with phrases that resonate in the imagination like bard song, whose imagery is rooted in woodland. With its emphasis on endings, renewal and the inexorable power of story, this a fitting intensive revisiting of the world and themes of Mythago Wood.&#34; -- Nic Clarke SFX &#34;The plot is as rich and inventive as ever (the wealth of possibilities contained in this primeval, haunted woodland seems inexhaustible), but the tone is lighter, with a wider range. There&#39;s even space for a few jokes, and many surprises. This is a wonderful, grown-up fantasy about growing up and moving on, and going home.&#34; -- Lisa Tuttle THE TIMES &#34;Avilion is quintessentially British fantasy, and a compelling and beautiful read.

Spanning a period of exceptional invention and transition, this volume is not only a critical companion to courses on Japanese literary and intellectual development but also an essential reference for scholarship on Japanese history, culture, and interactions with the East and West.<br><br>The first half covers the three major styles of literary expression that informed Japanese writing and performance in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: classical Japanese fiction and drama, Chinese poetry, and Western literary representation and cultural critique. Their juxtaposition brilliantly captures the social, intellectual, and political challenges shaping Japan during this period, particularly the rise of nationalism, the complex interaction between traditional and modern forces, and the encroachment of Western ideas and writing. The second half conveys the changes that have transformed Japan since the end of the Pacific War, such as the heady transition from poverty to prosperity, the friction between conflicting ideologies and political beliefs, and the growing influence of popular culture on the country's artistic and intellectual traditions. Featuring sensitive translations of works by Nagai Kafu, Natsume Soseki, Oe Kenzaburo, Kawabata Yasunari, Mishima Yukio, and many others, this anthology relates an essential portrait of Japan's dynamic modernization.</p><p>J.

JohnsonRobert F. Kennedy mutual-fear-and-loathing society. Entire books have been written examining Lyndon Johnson's presidency in which Robert F. Kennedy is but a very minor player. In his book, Shesol filters Johnson's entire vice-presidential and presidential careers through the lens of his hatred of Robert Kennedy and RFK's reciprocal contempt for Johnson. In his first book, Shesol, a political cartoonist, sets out to prove that from 1959 to 1968 both Kennedy and Johnson made ``few important decisions without first considering'' their mutual contempt, which was ``the defining relationship of their political lives.'' Shesol offers a mountain of evidence to buttress these original claims. The book is filled to overflowing with detailed reconstructions of many of the political actions RFK and LBJ took. Shesol is correct- -to a very limited degree. The two men hated each other viciously, and their hatred had an impact on some of their political decisions. Those facts are well documented here and elsewhere. But Shesol does not come close to proving that the mutual hatred was a key factor in Johnson's presidency or in Kennedy's political career. Shesol claims, for example, that Johnson's Vietnam War policymaking, by mid-1967, was ``inextricably bound to the Johnson-Kennedy feud.'' The feud had some impact, but Shesol either ignores or cursorily mentions the many other, much more crucial factors. They include the intransigence of the Vietnamese communists, the weakness of our South Vietnamese ally, pressures from the American Joint Chiefs and from conservative Republicans, threats from China, and Johnson's strong desire to win the 1964 election and, later, enact his Great Society programs. A myopic portrait of two powerful politicians that all but ignores any actions other than their spiteful, petulant, petty personal feuding.

Filled to the brim with crab pots, both ships, the <i>Americus</i> and the <i>Altair</i>, were considered state-of-the-art for the industry: each only a few years old, equipped with thousands of dollars' worth of lifesaving equipment. Neither ship returned to port, and none of their 14 crew members was ever seen again. It was the worst commercial fishing accident in America's history. <p> In <i>Lost at Sea</i>, Patrick Dillon examines how the <i>Americus/Altair</i> disaster is indicative of the problems with American fishing, an industry that annually tops the list of "Most Dangerous Occupations," and what has been done in the tragedy's aftermath. During his research, including a season as a crew member aboard a fishing boat, Dillon encountered a murky sea full of men fiercely opposed to government regulations, an industry that always expects to do business the same way--its <i>own</i> way--and, conversely, an American government that prodded its fishing industry into possibly unsafe practices in order to compete with foreign fishing powers. Dillon interviews dozens of friends, coworkers, and family members of the lost fishermen, and the scenes that describe the small Washington town of Anacortes, which hosted the lost fleet and is almost completely reliant on fishing for livelihood, are touching. In the end, despite years of hearings and probes into the fishing industry, not much has changed, Dillon reports. Every year a certain number of men go out into rough seas, and every year a smaller number of them return home, as the industry remains largely free of regulation. <i>--Tjames Madison</i></p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Saab 9-3 Petrol and Diesel Service and Repair Manual 2002 to 2007</h2><p>Does NOT cover new Saab 9-3 range introduced September 2007.

She loves to hear from readers and can be reached through her website at www.raeannethayne.com.Much as he loved Pine Gulch, Trace Bowman had to admit his town didn't offer its best impression in the middle of a cold, gray rain that leached the color and personality from it.<p>Even the Christmas decorations&#x2014;which still somehow could seem magical and bright to his cynical eye when viewed on a snowy December evening&#x2014;somehow came off looking only old and tired in the bleak late-November morning light as he parked his patrol SUV in front of The Gulch, the diner that served as the town's central gathering place.</p><p>That sleety rain dripping from the eaves and awnings of the storefronts would be snow by late afternoon, he guessed. Maybe earlier. This time of year&#x2014;the week after Thanksgiving&#x2014;in Pine Gulch, Idaho, in the western shadow of the Tetons, snow was more the norm than the exception.</p><p>He yawned and rotated his neck to ease some of the tightness and fatigue. After three days of double shifts, he was ready to head for his place a few blocks away, throw a big, thick log on the fire and climb into bed for the next week or so.</p><p>Food first. He'd eaten a quick sandwich for dinner around 6:00 p.m. More than twelve hours&#x2014;and the misery of dealing with a couple of weather-related accidents&#x2014;later and he was craving one of Lou Archuleta's sumptuous cinnamon rolls. Sleep could wait a half hour for him to fill up his tank.</p><p>He walked in and was hit by a welcome warmth and the smell of frying bacon and old coffee. From the tin-stamped ceiling to the row of round swivel seats at the old-fashioned counter, The Gulch fit every stereotype of the perfect small-town diner. The place oozed tradition and constancy. He figured if he moved away for twenty years, The Gulch would seem the same the moment he walked back through the doors.</p><p>"Morning, Chief!" Jesse Redbear called out from the booth reserved for the diner's regulars.</p><p>"Hey, Jesse."</p><p>"Chief."</p><p>"Chief."</p><p>Greetings assailed him from the rest of the booth, from Mick Malone and Sal Martinez and Patsy Halli-day. He could probably have squeezed into their corner booth but he still headed for an empty stool at the counter.</p><p>He waved at them all and continued his quick scan of the place, an old habit from his days as a military MP that still served him well. He recognized everyone in the room except for a couple he thought might be staying at the hotel and a girl reading a book in the corner. She looked to be his niece, Destry's, age and he had to wonder what a nine-year-old girl was doing by herself at The Gulch at 7:30 a.m. on a school day.</p><p>Then he noticed a slender woman standing at one of the back booths with an order pad in her hand. Since when did The Gulch have a new waitress? He'd been busy working double shifts after the wife of one of his men had a baby and he hadn't been in for a week or two, but last he knew, Donna Archuleta, the wife of the owner, seemed to handle the breakfast crowd fine on her own. Maybe she was finally slowing down now that she'd hit seventy.</p><p>"Hey, Chief," Lou Archuleta, Donna's husband and the cook, called out from behind the grill before Trace could ask Donna about the solitary girl or the new waitress. "Long night?"</p><p>How did Lou know he'd been working all night? Was he wearing a sign or something? Maybe the man just figured it out from his muddy boots and the exhaustion he was pretty sure was probably stamped on his features.</p><p>"It was a rough one. That freezing rain always keeps us hopping. I've been helping the state police out on the highway with a couple of weather-related accidents."</p><p>"You ought to be home in bed catching up." Donna, skinny and feisty, flipped a cup over and poured coffee into it for him. The last thing he needed was caffeine when he wanted to be asleep in about five minutes from now, but he decided not to make an issue of it.</p><p>"That's my plan, but I figured I'd sleep better on a full stomach."</p><p>"You want your regular?" she asked in her raspy ex-smoker's voice. "Western omelet and a stack?"</p><p>He shook his head. "No stack. I'm in the mood for one of Lou's sweet rolls this morning. Any left?"</p><p>"I think I can find one or two for our favorite man in blue."</p><p>"Thanks."</p><p>He eased his tired bones onto a stool and caught a better look at the new waitress. She was pretty and slender with dark hair pulled back in a haphazard sort of ponytail. More curious than he probably should be, he noted her white blouse seemed to be tailored and expensive. The hand holding a coffeepot was soft-looking with manicured nails.</p><p>What was someone in designer jeans doing serving coffee at The Gulch?</p><p>And not well, he noted as she splattered Maxwell House over the lip of Ronny Haskell's coffee cup. Ronny didn't seem to mind. He just smiled, somewhere in the vicinity of her chest region.</p><p>"Do you want something else to drink?" Donna asked him, apparently noticing he hadn't lifted his cup.</p><p>He gave her a rueful smile. "To be honest, I need sleep more than caffeine today. A small orange juice will do me."</p><p>"I should have thought about that. One OJ coming up."</p><p>She headed toward the small grill window to give his order to her husband and returned a minute later with his juice. Her hand shook a little as she set it down and he noted more signs of how Donna and Lou were both growing older. Maybe that's why they'd added a server to help with the breakfast crowd.</p><p>"Busy morning," he commented to Donna when she came back with the sweet roll, huge and gooey and warm.</p><p>"Let me tell you something. I've survived my share of Pine Gulch winters," she said. "In my experience, gloomy days like this make people either want to hunker down at home by themselves in front of the fire or seek out other people. Guess we've got more of the latter today."</p><p>The new waitress eased up to the window and tentatively handed an order to Lou before heading back to take the order of a couple of new arrivals.</p><p>"Who's the new blood?" he asked with a little head jerk in her direction.</p><p>Donna stopped just short of rolling her eyes. "Name's Parsons. Rebecca Parsons. But heaven forbid you make the mistake of calling her Becky. It's <i>Becca.</i> Apparently she inherited old Wally Taylor's place. His granddaughter, I guess."</p><p>That was news to Trace. He narrowed his gaze at the woman, suddenly put off. Wally had never spoken of a granddaughter. She sure hadn't been overflowing with concern for the old man. In his last few years, Trace had just about been his neighbor's only visitor. If he hadn't made a practice of checking on him a couple of times a week, Wally might have gone weeks without seeing another living soul.</p><p>Trace had been the first to find out that he'd passed away. When Trace hadn't seen him puttering around his yard for a couple of days or out with his grumpy mutt, Grunt, he'd stopped by to check and found him dead in his easy chair with the Game Show Network still on, Grunt whining at his feet.</p><p>Apparently his granddaughter had been too busy to come visit him but she hadn't blinked at moving in and taking over his house. It would serve her right if he dropped Grunt off for her. Lord knew he didn't need a grouchy, grieving, hideously ugly dog underfoot.</p><p>"That her kid?" he asked Donna.</p><p>She cast a quick look toward the booth where the girl was still engrossed in whatever she was reading. "Yeah. Fancy French name. <i>Gabrielle.</i> I told Becca the girl could spend an hour or so here before school starts, long as she behaves. This is her second morning here and she hasn't looked up from her book, not even to say thank-you when I fixed her a hot chocolate with extra whipped cream, on the house."</p><p>She seemed to take that as a personal affront and he had to smile. "Kids these days."</p><p>Donna narrowed her gaze at his cheek. "I'm just saying. Something's not right there."</p><p>"Order up," Lou called. "Chief's omelet's ready."</p><p>Donna headed back to the window and grabbed his breakfast and slid it expertly onto the counter. "You know where to find the salt and pepper and the salsa. But of course you won't need anything extra."</p><p>She headed off to take care of another customer and he dug into his breakfast. In the mirror above the counter, he had a perfect view of the new waitress as she scrambled around the diner. In the time it took him to finish his breakfast, he saw her mess up two orders and pour regular instead of decaf in old Bob Whitley's cup despite his doctor's orders that he had to ease up on the real stuff.</p><p>Oddly, she seemed to be going out of her way to avoid even making eye contact with him, though he thought he did intercept a few furtive glances in his direction. He ought to introduce himself. It was the polite thing to do, not to mention that he liked to make sure new arrivals to his town knew the police chief was keeping an eye out. But he wasn't necessarily inclined to be friendly to someone who could let a relative die a lonely death with only his farty, bad-tempered dog for company.</p><p>Fate took the decision out of his hands a moment later when the waitress fumbled the tray she was using to bus the table just adjacent to him. A couple of juice glasses slid off the edge and shattered on the floor.</p><p>"Oh, drat," the waitress exclaimed under her breath. The wimpy swear word almost made him smile. Only because he was so damn tired, he told himself.</p><p>On impulse, he unfolded himself from the barstool. "Need a hand?" he asked.</p><p>"Thank you! I..." She lifted her gaze from the floor to his jeans and then raised her eyes. When she identified him her hazel eyes turned from grateful to unfriendly and cold, as if he'd somehow thrown the glasses at her head.</p><p>He also thought he saw a glimmer of panic in those interesting depths, which instantly stirred his curiosity like cream swirling through coffee.</p><p>"I'...</p></p><h2>The Scarlet Pimpernel (Puffin Classics)</h2><p>A band of titled Englishmen, led by the Scarlet Pimpernel, assist condemned aristocrats in their escape to England during the Reign of Terror</p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettesThe first and most successful in the Baroness's series of books that feature Percy Blakeney, who leads a double life as an English fop and a swashbuckling rescuer of aristocrats, "The Scarlet Pimpernel was the blueprint for what became known as the masked-avenger genre.

To rise on the crest of laughter without capsizing, to survive being written, rewritten, and reinterpreted by each generation, is the mark of a plot that is timeless and universal, even though it happens to be set in England and France of 1792." <p>"From the Trade Paperback edition.</p></p><h2>Paiute Princess: The Story of Sarah Winnemucca</h2><p><p>Born into the Northern Paiute tribe of Nevada in 1844, Sarah Winnemucca straddled two cultures: the traditional life of her people, and the modern ways of her grandfather's white friends. Sarah was smart and good at languages, so she was able to link the worlds. As she became older, this made her a great leader. Sarah used condemning letters, fiery speeches, and her autobiography, <i>Life Among the Piutes, </i>to provide detailed accounts of her people's turmoil through years of starvation, unjust relocations, and violent attacks.

It is more than a matter of the number of digits on a paycheck or the number of possessions that one accumulates. It is instead a mindset centered on advancing the kingdom of God. Included at the end of the book is a chapter in whick Hybels discusses his struggle with the meaning and application of downward mobility to his own life. He says it is a difficult journey, but the only real option for a joy-filled life. &#34;Like Christ, we must decend-into self-abandoment, unconditional giving, sacrifice, and death to self. And, like Christ, we will then ascend-into fulfillment, blessing, joy, and purpose.&#34;</p><p>Bill Hybels, founder and pastor of Willow Creek Community Church, is the author of several books, including Honest to God?, Too Busy Not to Pray, and the previous titles in the Interactions series. He is also coauthor of Rediscovering Church, Becoming a Contagious Christian, and the best-selling Fit to Be TieIn a society where &#34;upward mobility&#34; is the highest goal, Bill Hybels asks a tough question: Do Christians place God&#39;s desires first-or their own? In Descending into Greatness, Hybels and writer Rob Wilkins take the example of Christ&#39;s downward journey as it was meant to be; the radical and essential answer for every Christian. In fourteen powerful chapters, the authors explore such topics as How Jesus managed power. The intentional decisions necessary to move down. The uplifting nature of true humility. Abundant life through dying to self. The ambush of joy. Moving down is never an easy matter that can be reduced to a formula. It involves a life committed to discipleship. Descending into Greatness introduces you to the touching stories of modern men and women committed to advancing the kingdom of God: from the pro football player, to the medical missionary, to a businessman wrestling with the priorities in the world of finance. Descending into Greatness asks tough questions and gives hopeful answers. Now, this powerful, urgent message also includes a discussion guide so that you can follow through, too. &#34;Like Christ, we must descend-into self-abandonment, unconditional giving, sacrifice, and death to self. And, like Christ, we will then ascend-into fulfillment, blessing, joy, and purpose.&#34;</p><h2>The Lotus-Born: The Life Story of Padmasambhava</h2><p>In English translation for the first time, this is &#34;the most authoritative scripture&#34; regarding how the Dharma was planted in Tibet, according to His Holiness Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche.

Now Segev explores the dramatic period before the creation of the state, when Britain ruled over "one Palestine, complete" (as noted in the receipt signed by the High Commissioner) and when its promise to both Jews and Arabs that they would inherit the land set in motion the conflict that haunts the region to this day.<br><br>Drawing on a wealth of untapped archival materials, Segev reconstructs a tumultuous era (1917 to 1948) of limitless possibilities and tragic missteps. He introduces the legendary figures--General Allenby, Lawrence of Arabia, David Ben-Gurion--as well as an array of pioneers, secret agents, diplomats, and fanatics. He tracks the steady advance of Jews and Arabs toward confrontation and with his hallmark originality puts forward a radical new argument: that the British, far from being pro-Arab, as commonly thought, consistently favored the Zionist position, and did so out of the mistaken--and anti-Semitic belief that Jews turned the wheels of history.<br><br>Rich in unforgettable characters, sensitive to all perspectives, <i>One Palestine, Complete</i> brilliantly depicts the decline of an empire, the birth of one nation, and the tragedy of another. <br></p><p>Topicality is never an issue where Israel and the Palestinians are concerned. The arguments--not to mention bloodshed--over Jewish and Muslim nationhood and land rights have been going on for centuries and, whatever the best intentions of the current peace process, they will probably go on for centuries to come. Both parties fanatically believe they have an inalienable historical right to statehood on the land in question and both regard Jerusalem as a holy city. As befits the disenfranchised, the Palestinians are slightly more open to a negotiated settlement, but the Israelis remain intransigent about handing over any but the most inhospitable of scrubland and the impasse remains. In the battle between the bullets and the ballot box, the bullets are winning hands-down.<p> Tom Segev is one of Israel's most notable historians and journalists--one of the few to strive for any sense of objectivity in his writings--so a new book by him is always worth waiting for. <i>One Palestine, Complete</i> is a detailed account of Palestine under British rule from 1917 to 1948, the critical period in the modern history of the region that led up to the creation of the state of Israel. Segev begins by carefully detailing Britain's well-known inconsistencies in dealing with both the Jews and the Arabs--to both of whom it had appeared to promise, if not the world, at least the country after independence was granted--and goes on to make a convincing case that because Palestine fell into the category of an emotional rather than self-interested colonial possession, the Brits hoped the situation would unwind to everyone's advantage.</p><p> Where Segev departs from the historical norm is in his assertions that whatever the British may have said to the Palestinians, their actions were uncompromisingly pro-Zionist from the start. This, he claims, was done out of the mistaken, anti-Semitic belief that the Jews controlled business and turned the wheels of history, rather than from a recognition of the rightness of their cause. Be this as it may, it is at best a partial explanation. Before World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II, Britain was on the verge of handing over Palestine to the Arabs, and Segev completely downplays the impact of Western war guilt over the Holocaust that led to a huge growth in support for an independent Israeli state at the expense of Palestinian rights.</p><p> Even so, <i>One Palestine, Complete</i> offers a thoughtful and dramatic account of the evolution of two nationalist movements that seem destined never to be reconciled. With a past like this, what hope is there for the future? <i>--John Crace, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Tom Segev is a columnist for <i>Ha'aretz</i>, Israel's leading newspaper, and author of two now-classic works on the history of Israel, <i>1949: The First Israelis</i> and <i>The Seventh Million: The Israelis and the Holocaust.</i> He lives in Jerusalem.<br></p><h2>Buffalo Nation: American Indian Efforts to Restore the Bison (Bison Original)</h2><p>The gruesome story of the devastation of buffalo herds in the late nineteenth century has become uncomfortably familiar. A less familiar story, but a hopeful one for the future, is Ken Zontek&#x2019;s account of Native peoples&#x2019; efforts to repopulate the Plains with a healthy, viable bison population. Interspersing scientific hypothesis with Native oral traditions and interviews, Buffalo Nation provides a brief history of bison and human interaction from the Paleolithic era to present preservation efforts.&nbsp;Zontek&#x2019;s history of bison restoration efforts is also a history of North American Native peoples&#x2019; pursuit of political and cultural autonomy, revealing how Native peoples&#x2019; ability to help the bison has fluctuated with their overall struggle. Beginning in the 1870s, Native North Americans established captive bison breeding programs despite the Wounded Knee Massacre and a massive onslaught on Native cultural and religious practices. These preservation efforts were so successful that a significant percentage of bison today carry the bloodlines of these original Native-sponsored herds. At the end of the twentieth century, more than fifty tribes banded together to form the Intertribal Bison Cooperative. This group has made significant progress in restoring bison herds in the United States, while Canadian First Nations work with national parks and other government entities to select and manage free-ranging herds.&nbsp;Buffalo Nation offers insights into the ways that the Native North American effort to restore the buffalo nation inspires discourse in cultural perseverance, environmentalism, politics, regionalism, spirituality, and the very essence of human-animal interaction.</p><p>Ken Zontek, PhD, teaches history at Yakima Valley Community College and serves as an adjunct professor at Heritage University on the Yakama Reservation.&nbsp; He is an active scholar in central Washington, and contributed to the <i>Encyclopedia of the Great Plains</i> (Nebraska 2004).&#x201c;This is a complete book on Natives and their relationship to bison. It is an important historical record, yet is as up-to-date as today&#x2019;s headlines in the continuing search for compromise and success in providing wildlife biodiversity once again in the Great Plains.&#x201d;&#x2014;Francis Moul, <i>Lincoln Journal Star</i> (<i>Lincoln Journal Star</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Highly recommended.

In his notes and list of references, the author touches on studies and publications that give the reader a good foundation for further research. I would recommend <i>Buffalo Nation</i> as a good introduction to the relationship between bison and North American native people.

UP.</p><p>Thomas Jefferson spent five years in Paris, from 1784 to 1789, serving as the representative of a struggling new nation. In this entertaining, scholarly chronicle of those years, we&#39;re treated to an account of how the nights spent among the Paris intellectuals influenced Jefferson&#39;s thought, and we get a vivid taste of the social whirl in that great European city. William Howard Adams, a leading Jefferson scholar for 25 years, quotes extensively from Jefferson&#39;s letters and other writings, and does a commendable job of describing the scenes in which Jefferson would have found himself.In an elegantly written survey, Adams, a historian, critically examines the effects on Thomas Jefferson of his period as American minister to Paris during the waning years of the ancien r&#x201a;gime. In retrospect, Jefferson's arrival in Paris in 1784 as the representative of the fledgling US may seem inauspicious: The new country was mired in debt, particularly to France, from the recently ended revolution; indeed, America may have seemed little more than a banana republic, barely united under the patchwork Articles of Confederation; and Jefferson, a retiring figure from a rural backwater whose principal authorship of the Declaration of Independence was generally unknown in France, seemed ill-suited to succeed the popular, cosmopolitan Benjamin Franklin as America's representative in the sophisticated French capital. In the event, Adams shows, Jefferson excelled as a diplomat. He succeeded in opening up French markets for American exports, in negotiating payment of the enormous debt to France, and in establishing credibility for the new country, while receiving a peerless education in Europe's Machiavellian politics that stood him in good stead when he became president. Meanwhile, as Adams demonstrates at great length, Jefferson fit well into the aesthetic, intellectual, and scientific circles of Paris. His friendships with leading intellects of the period, like Condorcet and Lavoisier, as well as with great salon leaders like Madame d'Houdetot and Madame Helvetius, broadened his outlook and introduced him to the best of European culture. Adams examines in detail the social aspects of Jefferson's life in Paris and his many close friendships with women. He also suggests that Jefferson developed a taste for French radicalism during his Paris years that led him to support the French Revolution even after the Terror had claimed the lives of close friends. A balanced and well-researched look at Jefferson's life and intellect during a crucial period in his development. (68 illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In the twenty years since, she has written 89 more novels and become the third largest selling female author in the world, with 300 million copies of her books sold in 19 languages in 98 countries. Her most recent bestsellers, Masquerade, Rivals, and Heiress, have all sold more than one million copies each. She is known for her strong, decisive characters, her extraordinary ability to re-create a time and place, and her unerring courage to confront important, controversial issues, like alcoholism and sexual abuse, in her stories.<p>All of her novels are meticulously researched, an endeavor she shares with her husband, Bill Dailey. The couple met in 1963, when Janet worked as a secretary for the construction company Bill owned. The two travel extensively to scout story locations, and have visited all 50 states; these days, they are likely to fly, but miss the time when they drove cross country, a trailer attached to their car. Janet Dailey also reads voraciously about every aspect of any subject she writes about; as she remarks, "Accuracy is important in genre fiction; you have to get it right, zero in on the real details. That's the way to make writing come alive and not irritate the readers with carelessness."</p><p>When they are not traveling, the couple spend time at their home on the shore of Lake Taneycomo in Branson, Missouri. It is the part of the country Dailey loves best, partly because, she says, "The people around me are more interested in their problems and their lives, and that sort of keeps me in touch with reality. They think it's nice that I write, but they really couldn't care less."</p><p>Allison Janney has been featured on Broadway (Present Laughter), in films (Big Night and First Wives Club) and on television shows on all four networks.</p><p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> An indifferent sun sat in the endless stretch of Montana sky, blazing down on the confused and bawling steers that jammed the cattle pens next to the railroad track. The chugging hiss of the motionless locomotive could barely be heard above the bewildered lowing of the steers and the clatter of cloven hooves on the wooden ramp of the loading chutes. The noise was punctuated by shouts and curses from cowboys as they poked the steers with long prods to force them up the chute and into the rail cars. </p><p> "Eighteen!" </p><p> With one cattle car filled to capacity, the locomotive rumbled out of its idle snoring to pull its string of cars ahead so the next one could be loaded. Plumes of smoke rose from its stack as the lumbering train's clanks and rattles added to the existing cacophony. Loading cattle destined for the slaughterhouses in the East was a tedious chore, made more unpleasant by the noise and the collective stench of penned animals. </p><p> Benteen Calder watched the proceedings from the sidelines. The wide hat brim shaded his sun-creased features and partially concealed his restless, assessing gaze. His dark hair was shot with silver and the middle fifties had put some weight on his big-boned frame, but there was no mistaking that he was of the kind that produced the cattle kings. Piece by piece, he had carved out the Triple C Ranch with his sweat, his blood, and his cunning. He'd fought outlaws, renegade Indians, and greedy neighbors to keep the ranch. There would always be someone wanting it. And the man christened Chase Benteen Calder knew that. </p><p> The cattle being driven up the loading chute carried the Triple C brand, marking them as the property of the Calder Cattle Company -- his ranch. The dry summer had left the steers in less than top condition for market, but the weather in eastern Montana was seldom ideal. </p><p> After nearly six weeks of roundup, Benteen was conscious of the soreness in his aging muscles. Absently, he rubbed at the stiffness in his left arm. He picked up a movement to the right and shifted his head slightly to identify the figure approaching him. The corners of his mouth lifted in a silent greeting as Benteen recognized the railroad man, Bobby John Thomas. </p><p> "Oughta be through loadin' here in another hour," the man observed without any preliminary greeting. </p><p> "More or less," Benteen agreed with a faint nod. </p><p> The local railroad man's sharp eyes spotted a steer with an odd brand among the penned cattle. "I see you picked up some estrays. Diamond T." He read the brand and frowned. "Don't recall seeing that brand around here." </p><p> "I think it's a Dakota brand." It was impossible to know the various brands of ranches located outside of the state, and Benteen didn't try. "All told, we've got fourteen estrays in this shipment." </p><p> A description of each was listed on the shipping manifest. Given the wandering tendencies of cattle and their lack of respect for boundary lines or fences, it was inevitable that a beef roundup would include cattle owned by other outfits. Reps from neighboring ranches were always on hand for just that reason. If there was no representative for a given brand with the crew, the animal was always included in the market shipment. Left to roam, the estrayed cattle would eventually die of old age, benefiting no one. More important, it would eat grass that could have supported the range owner's cattle. </p><p> When the estrayed steer arrived at the terminal market, a brand inspector would spot it and payment for its sale would be forwarded to the animal's rightful owner. Such a practice, by both the rancher finding the estray and the brand inspector, was regarded as a courtesy of the range, observed by all and rarely abused. It was the Golden Rule put into practice -- "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." </p><p> Another railroad car had its load of steers and the door was slid shut. The train's engine began a racing chug to bring the next car into position. During the short respite in the loading operation, one of the cowboys stepped down from his perch on the chute and removed his hat, wiping his forearm across his brow, then jammed his hat back onto his nearly black hair all in one motion. A brief glimpse at his angular features, the color and texture of richly grained leather, was enough to hint at a similarity between the young cowboy and the owner of the penned cattle. </p><p> Bobby John Thomas looked at Benteen. "Is that yore boy Webb?" </p><p> There was an imperceptible tightening of Benteen's mouth as he nodded an affirmative answer. A troubled light flickered in his eyes, put there by a gnawing worry that wouldn't go away. </p><p> "He sure has growed since the last time I saw him," the railroad agent remarked. </p><p> "Yeah." The abruptness of the response seemed to carry a negative connotation. Benteen didn't volunteer the information that, so far, Webb had only grown in size. The promise his son had shown in his early years hadn't yet developed in adulthood. </p><p> There was much about the tall, huskily built youth for Benteen to be proud of. At twenty-six, Webb was one of the top hands on the Triple C Ranch. He could ride the rankest bronc, rope with the best of them, and turn his hand to almost anything. Webb never shirked from hard work, so Benteen couldn't fault him for that. It was responsibility that Webb avoided, accepting it only when it was forced on him. On those rare occasions, he handled it well, making few wrong decisions. But it was that lack of interest in assuming an active role in the management of the ranch that troubled Benteen. The more he pushed Webb about it, reminding him that the Triple C would be his someday, the less interest Webb displayed. </p><p> Lorna didn't help the situation by insisting that Benteen was expecting too much from their son. It was her opinion that Webb was still too young and needed time to sow his wild oats before taking on any responsibility in running the ranch. Maybe she was right, but he'd been the same age as Webb when he'd driven the herd of Longhorns north from Texas to found the Triple C Ranch. It worried him to think he'd raised a son who was content to take orders instead of giving them. The future of the ranch depended on his son. </p><p> Moving his attention from the leanly muscled frame of his big-boned son, the source of his vague anxiety, Benteen half-turned toward the agent. His face showed none of his inner disturbance. </p><p> "Ya been keeping busy, Bobby John?" he inquired. </p><p> "We've been busy, but we haven't been makin' much money," the agent declared on a rueful note. </p><p> Benteen's mouth quirked in a dry line. "That's always the railroad's complaint. And it gets harder to swallow every time I see the freight rates go up." </p><p> "It's a fact." Bobby John was a loyal company man. "We may haul a lot of cattle out of Miles City in the fall, but we don't haul enough in or out on a regular basis. We just ain't got the people here, or the goods." </p><p> "I suppose," Benteen conceded. </p><p> "That might all change, though." The comment was made, then left to lie there like a baited hook allowed to settle near a submerged log where a big fish rested. </p><p> Benteen's interest in the conversation was no longer idle, his curiosity aroused by the remark. "Why is that?" </p><p> "Some fella plowed him some ground up around the Musselshell River and planted him some wheat. Rumor has it that he harvested forty bushels to an acre." He saw the skepticism in Benteen's dark eyes. "He used that dryland method of farming like they developed in Kansas." </p><p> Benteen had a sketchy understanding of the principle involved in such a method. In arid land where there wasn't a local water source to provide irrigation, crops were planted on only half the acreage while the other half was left fallow. This idle land was plowed and harrowed so no plant life would consume any moisture that fell on it. The next year, that half would be planted to crops. It was a way of conserving the moisture from rain and snow for the next year's use. </p><p> "It won't work here," Benteen stated flatly, regardless of the evidence just given to the contrary. "This is cow country. That's all it is good for. Besides, I've never heard of a farmer yet who could make a living on just eighty acres." That was half of the one hundred and sixty acres entitled for homestead, and the only part that was productive at any one time under the dryland method of farming. </p><p> "That may be true," Bobby John admitted. "But I've heard talk that there's a proposal bein' presented to the Congress to double the amount of acreage allowed under the Homestead Act." </p><p> Benteen's chin lifted a fraction of an inch in reaction to this new information. An uneasy feeling ran through him as he looked beyond the cattle pens of the railroad yard to the grassland. </p><p> In the autumn afternoon the stark Montana landscape looked like a sea of tanned stalks. It was the best damned grass any cowman could hope to find. The idea of its being ripped up by a plow and replaced by wheat was more than he could stand. A lot of things were different from the way they had been when he had first arrived in the territory, but this was one change Benteen wouldn't accept. He'd fight any attempt to turn this cow country into farmland. </p><p> "They'll never be able to push that bill through Congress." There was a steely quality to his voice, but the prospect of a battle, political or otherwise, added its weight to the tiredness in his bones. </p><p> "I wouldn't be too sure about that," Bobby John Thomas warned him. "It ain't just a bunch of land-hungry farmers that wants to see it pass." But he added no more than that. </p><p> Benteen silently cursed himself for speaking without thinking through the opposition. Farmers were the least of his worries. It was the railroads. They were land-poor in this part of the West, owners of thousands of square-mile tracts of land along their right-of-way, deeded to them by the U.S. government for laying track. The railroads would use an enlarged Homestead Act like a carrot to lure the farmers out here and end up selling them land for farms or townsites. They'd create a land boom that would bring settlers in, tradesmen as well as farmers. People needed products, which meant more freight generated for the railroads. </p><p> It didn't take much intelligence to figure it out. The railroads had done the same thing in Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado, where that prairie sod was now sown with some Russian strain of wheat. But this land wasn't the same. Methods that worked there couldn't work here. </p><p> The proposal coming before Congress had to be stopped, and stopped swiftly. Benteen knew in his gut that he couldn't waste any time, yet the six-week-long roundup had left him in a state of fatigue. Even if he looked the physical equal of his son, he no longer had the resilience of his youth. </p><p> "Guess I'd better be gettin' back to my office." Bobby John Thomas shifted his position in a show of reluctance to put his words into action, but Benteen said nothing to invite the railroad agent to stay longer and chat. "Give my regards to your missus." </p><p> "I will." An image formed in his mind of Lorna waiting for him at the hotel in town. He suddenly felt an overwhelming need to be with her. Benteen barely noticed the agent move away, his attention already traveling down another channel. His glance swept the cattle pens and loading platform in an effort to locate Barnie Moore, then came to a stop on his son. Dammit, it was going to be his ranch and his land someday, Benteen thought with a frown of irritable concern. "Webb!" There was an edge to his voice as he raised its volume to make himself heard. </p><p> With a turn of his head, Webb looked over his shoulder and saw the single motion from his father that indicated he wanted to speak to him. He swung down from the loading chute onto the platform and handed the long prod to another cowboy to take his place. As Webb approached his father, he experienced that strange feeling of pride and resentment -- pride for the man that Chase Benteen Calder was and the wide swath he'd cut across this land practically singlehandedly, and resentment for the same reasons. </p><p> He didn't want to be his father's son; he didn't want to be singled out from the other hands because his name was Calder; he wanted to earn his right to command, even though he was born in the position to inherit it. He would rather have been born Webb Smith than Webb Calder, so his was a quiet rebellion -- never overt, always subtle -- denying himself the right to claim what was his by birth. Webb made it a practice not to assert himself or his opinions with the other ranch hands. In spite of that, all the cowboys, except the older ones who had come north with his father, turned to Webb whenever there was a decision to be made, deferring to him because he was a Calder. That angered him, although he seldom let it show. </p><p> Webb knew his father was disappointed in him. He'd been lectured enough times about accepting responsibility. Only once had Webb tried to explain the way he felt, his determination to be accepted because of his ability, rather than rest on the circumstances of his birth. His father had brushed it aside as a foolish whim, needlessly reminding Webb that he couldn't change the fact that he was born a Calder. Rebuffed by this lack of understanding, Webb had taken the lonely path, not able to be just one of the boys and refusing to assume the role his father wanted for him. More than once, he had considered tying his bedroll on the back of his saddle and riding away from the Triple C; then he'd think about his mother and he'd stay, hoping something would change. </p><p> "Yes, sir?" Webb stopped in front of his father, letting the inflection of his voice question why he had been summoned. He hadn't addressed him as Pa in more than six years. </p><p> There was nothing in his son's attitude or expression that showed more than casual interest. Benteen probed, hoping to find more. He never knew what the boy was thinking -- or if he was thinking. A father should know what was going on in his son's head. Benteen knew he didn't. </p><p> "I want you to go to the telegraph office and send some wires for me," Benteen stated. "One of them goes to Frank Bulfert, the senator's aide, in Washington. In the wire, I want you to ask him the status of the proposal being brought to Congress to enlarge the Homestead Act and what kind of preliminary support it's getting. Ask for the same information from Asa Morgan in Helena. The last wire I want you to send to Bull Giles at the Black Dove Bar in Washington with the same request for information." The lack of interest Webb showed made him feel weary. "Have you got all that?" </p><p> "Yes, sir." Behind the smooth exterior, his mind was running over the possible significance of the information being sought and how it might affect the ranch. "Is there anything else?" </p><p> "No." His lips thinned into a tired line. "Don't you want to know why this information is important?" Benteen asked, and had the satisfaction of seeing his son's steady gaze waver briefly. </p><p> "I figured you'd tell me when you thought it was right for me to know." There was no hesitation over the reply, and the invitation to ask...</p></p><h2>From the Margins: Historical Anthropology and Its Futures</h2><p>Historical anthropology: critical exchange between two decidedly distinct disciplines or innovative mode of knowledge production? As this volume&#x2019;s title suggests, the essays Brian Keith Axel has gathered in <i>From the Margins</i> seek to challenge the limits of discrete disciplinary epistemologies and conventions, gesturing instead toward a transdisciplinary understanding of the emerging relations between archive and field. <br>In original articles encompassing a wide range of geographic and temporal locations, eminent scholars contest some of the primary preconceptions of their fields. The contributors tackle such topics as the paradoxical nature of American Civil War monuments, the figure of the &#x201c;New Christian&#x201d; in early seventeenth-century Peru, the implications of statistics for ethnography, and contemporary South Africa's &#x201c;occult economies.&#x201d; That anthropology and history have their provenance in&#x2014;and have been complicit with&#x2014;colonial formations is perhaps commonplace knowledge. But what is rarely examined is the specific manner in which colonial processes imbue and threaten the celebratory ideals of postcolonial reason or the enlightenment of today&#x2019;s liberal practices in the social sciences and humanities. <br>By elaborating this critique, <i>From the Margins</i> offers diverse and powerful models that explore the intersections of historically specific local practices with processes of a world historical order. As such, the collection will not only prove valuable reading for anthropologists and historians, but also for scholars in colonial, postcolonial, and globalization studies. <br><i><br>Contributors.</i> Talal Asad, Brian Keith Axel, Bernard S.

He lives in London, where he is at work on his sixth novel featuring Arthur Bryant and John May.Chapter One<br><i><br><br>A change in the weather<br></i><br>Arthur Bryant looked out over London and remembered.<br><br>Fierce sunlight swathed Tower Bridge beyond the rockeries of smouldering bomb-sites. A Thames sailing barge was arriving in the Pool of London with a cargo of palm kernels. Its dusty red sails sagged in the afternoon heat as it drifted past Broadway Dock at Limehouse, like a felucca on the Nile. Dairy horses trotted along the deserted Embankment, empty milk cans chiming behind them. Children swam from the wharves below St Paul&#x2019;s, while carping mothers fanned away stale air from the river steps. He could smell horse dung and tobacco, meadow grass, the river. The world had once moved forward in single paces.<br><br>The vision wavered and vanished, displaced by sun-flares from the sealed glass corridors of the new city.<br><br>The old man in the unravelling sepia scarf waited for the rest of the party to gather around him. It was a Saturday afternoon at the start of October, and London&#x2019;s thirteen-week heatwave was about to end with a vengeance. Already, the wind had changed direction, stippling the surface of the river with grey goose-pimples. Above the spire of St Paul&#x2019;s, patulous white clouds deepened to a shade reminiscent of overwashed socks. The enervating swelter was giving way to a cool breeze, sharp in the shadows. The change had undermined his group&#x2019;s stamina, reducing their numbers to a handful, although four polite but puzzled Japanese boys had joined thinking they were on the Jack the Ripper tour. Once everyone had settled, the elderly guide began the last section of his talk.<br><br>&#x2018;Ladies and gentlemen . . .&#x2019; He gave them the benefit of the doubt. &#x2018;If you would care to gather a little closer.&#x2019; Arthur Bryant raised his voice as a red wall of buses rumbled past. &#x2018;We are now standing on Blackfriars&#x2014;formerly Pitt&#x2014;Bridge.&#x2019; Remember to use the hands, he told himself. Keep their interest. &#x2018;Bridges are causeways across great divides, in this case the rich city on the north side&#x2014;&#x2019;hand usage to indicate north&#x2014;&#x2018;and the more impoverished south side. Does anyone have a Euro note in their pocket? Take it out and you&#x2019;ll find a bridge, the universal symbol for something that unites and strengthens.&#x2019; He paused, less for effect than to catch his breath. Bryant really had no need to freelance as a city tour guide. His detective duties at the London Peculiar Crimes Unit would have kept a man half his age working late. But he enjoyed contact with the innocent public; most of the civilians he met in his day job were under criminal suspicion. Explaining the city to strangers calmed him down, even helped him to understand himself.<br><br>He pulled his ancient scarf tighter and abandoned his set text. What the hell, they were the last group of the season, and had proven pretty unresponsive. &#x2018;According to Disraeli,&#x2019; he announced, &#x2018; &#x201c;London is a nation, not a city.&#x201d; &#x201c;That great cesspool into which all the loungers of the Empire are irresistibly drained,&#x201d; said Conan Doyle. &#x201c;No duller spectacle on earth than London on a rainy Sunday afternoon,&#x201d; according to De Quincey, so take your pick. One of the planet&#x2019;s great crossing-points, it has more languages, religions and newspapers than any other place on earth. We divide into tribes according to age, wealth, class, race, religion, taste and personality, and this diversity breeds respect.&#x2019; Two members of the group nodded and repeated the word &#x2018;diversity&#x2019;, like an Oxford Street language class. God, this lot&#x2019;s hard work, thought Bryant. I&#x2019;m gasping for a cup of tea.<br><br>&#x2018;London&#x2019;s main characteristic is an absence of form. Its thirty-three boroughs have busy districts running through them like veins, with no visible hierarchy, and neighbourhood ties remain inexplicably close. Because Londoners have a strongly pronounced sense of home, where you live counts more than who you are.&#x2019; Bryant mostly lived inside his head. Remember the facts, he told himself, they like facts.<br><br>&#x2018;We have six royal parks, 160 theatres, 8,600 restaurants, 300 museums and around 30,000 shops. Over 3,500 criminal offences are reported every day. Poverty and wealth exist side by side, often in the same street. Bombings caused slum clearance and social housing, rupturing centuries-old barriers of class, turning the concept into something mysterious and ever-shifting. London is truly unknowable.&#x2019;<br><br>Bryant looked past his under-dressed audience to the swirling brown river. The Japanese boys were bored and cold, and had started taking pictures of litter bins. One of them was listening to music. &#x2018;A city of cruelty and kindness, stupidity and excess, extremes and paradoxes,&#x2019; he told them, raising his voice. &#x2018;Almost half of all journeys through the metropolis are made on foot. A city of glass, steel, water and flesh that no longer smells of beer and brick, but piss and engines.&#x2019;<br><br>He lifted his silver-capped walking stick to the sky. &#x2018;The arches of London&#x2019;s Palladian architecture lift and curve in secular harmonies. Walls of glass reflect wet pavements in euphonious cascades of rain.&#x2019; He was no longer addressing the group, but voicing his thoughts. &#x2018;We&#x2019;re heading for winter, when a caul of sluggishness deepens into thanatomimesis, the state of being mistaken for death. But the city never dies; it just lies low. Its breath grows shallow in the cold river air while housebound tenants, flu-ridden and fractious with the perpetual motion of indoor activity, recover and grow strong once more. London and its people are parasites trapped in an ever-evolving symbiosis. At night the residents lose their carapace of gentility, bragging and brawling through the streets. The old London emerges, dancing drunk skeletons leaving graveyard suburbs to terrify the faint of heart.&#x2019;<br><br>Now even the hardiest listeners looked confused. They spoke to each other in whispers and shook their heads. Their guide seemed to be straying from his topic: &#x2018;A Historic Thameside Walk&#x2019;. The Japanese boys gave up and wandered off. Someone said, rather loudly, &#x2018;This tour was much better last time. There was a caf�.&#x2019;<br><br>Bryant carried on, regardless.<br><br>&#x2018;London no longer suffers from the weight of its past. Now only the faintest resonance of legendary events remains. Oh, I can show you balustrades, pillars and scrollwork, point out sites of religious and political interest, streets that have witnessed great events, but to be honest there&#x2019;s bugger all to see. It&#x2019;s impossible to imagine the lives of those who came before us. Our visible history has been rubbed to a trace, like graffiti scrubbed from Portland stone. London has reinvented itself more completely than ever. And whoever grows up here becomes a part of its human history.&#x2019;<br><br>He had completely lost his listeners. They were complaining to each other in dissatisfaction and disarray. &#x2018;That concludes the tour for today,&#x2019; he added hastily. &#x2018;I think we&#x2019;ll skip question time, you&#x2019;ve been a truly dreadful audience.&#x2019; He decided not to bother with his tip box as the mystified, grumbling group was forced to disperse across the windy bridge.<br><br>Bryant looked toward the jumble of outsized apartment buildings being constructed at the edge of the Thames, the yellow steel cranes clustered around them like praying mantises. After so many years in the service, he was quick to sense approaching change. Another wave of executives was colonizing the riverbank, creating a new underclass. He wondered how soon the invasion would provoke fresh forms of violence.<br><br>It&#x2019;s metabolizing quickly, he thought. How long before it becomes unrecognizable? How can I hope to understand it for much longer?<br><br>He turned up his collar as he passed the urban surfers of the South Bank car park. The clatter of their skateboards bounced between the concrete arcades like the noise of shunting trains. Kids always found ways to occupy ignored spaces. He emerged into daylight and paced at the river rail, studying the evolving skyline of the Thames.<br><br>Hardly anything left of my childhood memories.<br><br>The Savoy, St Paul&#x2019;s, the spire of St Bride&#x2019;s, a few low monuments palisaded by international banks as anonymous as cigarette boxes. A city in an apostasy of everything but money. Even the river had altered. The ships and barges, no longer commercially viable, had left behind an aorta of bare brown water. Eventually only vast hotels, identical from Chicago to Bangkok, would remain.<br><br>As ever, Londoners had found ways of cutting grand new structures down to human size. The &#x2018;Blade of Light&#x2019; connecting St Paul&#x2019;s to Bankside had become known as &#x2018;The Wobbly Bridge&#x2019;. The Swiss Re building had been rechristened &#x2018;The Erotic Gherkin&#x2019; long before its completion. Names were a sign of affection, to be worn like guild colours. The old marks of London, from its financial institutes to its market buildings, were fading from view like vanishing coats of arms.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve been walking this route for over half a century, Bryant thought, stepping aside for a wave of shrieking children. A Mexican band was playing in the foyer of the Festival Hall. People were queueing for an art event involving tall multi-coloured flags. He remembered walking through the black empty streets after the War, and feeling completely alone. It was hard to feel alone here now. He missed the sensation.<br><br>His fingers closed around the keys in his pocket. Sergeant Longbright had mentioned she might go into the unit today in order to get things straight for Monday. He preferred to work out of hours, when the phonelines were closed and he could leave papers all over the floor without complaint. He could join Janice, collect his thoughts, smoke his pipe, prepare himself for a fresh start. For a woman who had recen...</p><h2>An Irish Country Christmas</h2><p>The author recounts Christmas stories from her childhood in the snowy Irish countryside, capturing the sights and sounds of holiday festivities among her family, beginning with the lighting of the Christmas candle.</p><p>Taylor (To School Through the Fields) has written a memoir of a County Kerry Christmas as seen through her own nine-year-old eyes. First there is the fattening of the pet-like geese. Their execution and plucking follows. Then the countdown to Christmas begins: waiting for the "master" to let the children know when the school holiday is to begin; the letters to Santa; the preparation of the Christmas chimney for Santa by the sweep, Black Ned; the hunt for holly; the housing of the farm animals for the winter; and the house cleanup in readiness for the big day. Finally, Christmas arrives with mass and a "Happy Birthday" to the infant Jesus. The holiday ends with the hunt for the wren-bird one day later on St. Stephen's Day. With liberal sprinkling of the Irish language, neighbor Mrs. Casey's tales of supernatural Christmases past and the family's thought of soft barm bracks, Taylor has written a tender remembrance of a simpler, yet harder, time past. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.This is a perfect matching of subject and author, for what time of the year evokes more wistful nostalgia than Christmas, and who is more skillful at evoking childhood's innocent sensuality, the basis of that nostalgia? Taylor's charm-drenched memoir never, despite its sugarplumminess, cloys or becomes saccharine. Its chapters are like late-Victorian holiday cards, festive and cheerful and replete with natural symbols. We meet the Christmas geese, before and after plucking (the actual foul play takes place offstage, in the basement, where Mom handles the butchery). Silent, skinny Black Ned comes to sweep the chimney, precipitating an orgy of house cleaning and decorating. The family traipses through the blackthorn hedges to find the perfect branches. Mail from far-off America arrives, sometimes bearing curious presents. The family gathers around the sweet turf fire, raises glasses, and cheers in the New Year. These are holidays as everyone wishes they could remember them. <i>Patricia Monaghan</i></p><h2>Tales from the Crypt #1: The Stalking Dead</h2><p>Zombies on Wall Street! A vampire elected president!

Like filmmaker Federico Fellini, Bradbury is fascinated by the seedy splendor of cheap carnivals and circuses--"a long time before, in the early Twenties, these cages had probably rolled by like bright summer storms with animals prowling them, lions opening their mouths to exhale hot meat breaths. Teams of white horses had dragged their pomp through Venice and across the fields."<p> But now it's the early 1950s, and foggy, shabby Venice is the last stop on the circus train for scores of old silent-movie stars and young writers trying to keep their art and their bodies alive. As Bradbury's autobiographical hero, a young writer, pounds out his short stories, someone is killing off the older denizens of the tacky city. The writer joins forces with a quirky detective called Elmo Crumley and a faded screen star to investigates the deaths. Their search begins and ends in one of those iconic, waterlogged cages.</p><p> Blending hard-boiled detective fiction with beautiful descriptions of this strange Californian town, <i>Death Is a Lonely Business</i> is well worth investigating. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Hippie Modernism: The Struggle for Utopia</h2><p><p><i>Hippie Modernism</i> examines the art, architecture and design of the counterculture of the 1960s and early 1970s.

He lives in New York City.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>The Explorers</b> </p><p> We Americans have learned about the development of the West from history books, school texts, novels, movies and TV screens. In so doing we have been silently saddled with the myth that the frontier cast of characters included only white and red men. Although western stereotypes abound-treacherous red men, hearty pioneers, intrepid explorers, gentle missionaries, heroic and handsome cowboys and cavalrymen -- black men and women do not appear. </p><p> In 1942 Pulitzer-prize historian James Truslow Adams, author and editor of more than two dozen volumes on American history, insisted that black men "were unfitted by nature from becoming founders of communities on the frontier as, let us say the Scotch Irish were preeminently fitted for it...." To be sure, black men had "many excellent qualities," Adams noted, "even temper, affection, great loyalty...imitativeness, willingness to follow a leader or master," but these were, one must agree, "not the qualities which...made good...frontiersmen...." The racial bias and misinformation upon which this statement was based has been traditional among American historians -- and has prolonged our ignorance. </p><p> Black men sailed with Columbus and accompanied many of the European explorers to the New World. Pedro Alonzo Nino, said to be black, was on Columbus's first voyage, and other Africans sailed with him on his second voyage the following year. By Columbus's third voyage in 1498 the black population of the New World was expanding, its economic value slowly being recognized by the Spanish and Portuguese. </p><p> The Spaniards saw the Africans as both useful and dangerous. In 1501 when a royal ordinance first gave official sanction to the importation of African slaves to Hispaniola, many feared to use them because of their rebelliousness. Two years later Governor Ovando of Hispaniola complained to King Ferdinand that his African slaves "fled among the Indians and taught them bad customs and never would be captured." His solution, however, based on labor needs, was to remove all restrictions on their importation. He evidently won his point at the Spanish court. On September 15, 1505, King Ferdinand wrote him: "I will send more Negro slaves on your request. I think there may be a hundred. At each time a trustworthy person will go with them who may share in the gold they may collect and may promise them ease if they work well." By 1537, the governor of Mexico noted, "I have written to Spain for black slaves because I consider them indispensable for the cultivation of the land and the increase of the royal revenue." Ten years earlier Antonio de Herrera, royal historian to King Philip II of Spain, estimated their New World colonies as having about ten thousand Africans. This was ninety-two years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth. By 1600, more than ninety thousand Africans had been sent to Latin America. The landings at Jamestown and Plymouth were still to come. </p><p> When the Spanish conquistadores left Hispaniola to explore the mainland of the Americas, black men accompanied them. In 1513 Balboa's men, including thirty Africans, hacked their way through the lush vegetation of Panama and reached the Pacific. There the party paused and built the first ships ever constructed on America's west coast. In 1519 Africans accompanied Cortez when he conquered the Aztecs; the three hundred Africans dragged his huge cannons. One of Cortez's black men then planted and remained to harvest the first wheat crop in the New World. Others were with Ponce de Leon in Florida and Pizarro in Peru, where they carried his murdered body to the cathedral. </p><p> <i>Pioneer Maroon Settlements</i> </p><p> From the misty dawn of America's earliest foreign landings, Africans who broke their chains fled to the wilderness to create their own "maroon" settlements (after a Spanish word for runaways). Europeans saw "maroons" as a knife poised at the heart of the slave system, perhaps pressed against the entire thin line of white military rule in the New World. But for the daring men and women who built these outlaw communities in the wilderness, they were a pioneer's promise. </p><p> In remote areas of the Americas beyond the reach of European armies many became strongly defended agricultural and trading centers bearing such names as "Disturb Me If You Dare" and "Try Me If You Be Men." Maroon songs resonate with defiance: "Black man rejoice/White man won't come here/And if he does/The Devil will take him off." For more than 90 years in 17th century Brazil the Republic of Palmares fought off onslaughts by Dutch and Portuguese troops. In 1719 a Brazilian colonist wrote to King Jao of Portugal of maroons: "Their self-respect grows because of the fear whites have of them." </p><p> Women played a vital role in these pioneer settlements. Often in short supply, they were sought as revered wives and mothers who would provide stability, the nourishment of family life and children, the community's future. Families meant these enclaves would strive for peace, but that their soldiers would fight invading slave-catching armies to the death. </p><p> Two women ruled maroon settlements in colonial Brazil. Fillipa Maria Aranha governed a colony in Amazonia where her military prowess convinced Portuguese officials it was wiser to negotiate than try to defeat her armies. A treaty granted Aranha's people independence, liberty and sovereignty. In Passanha, an unnamed African woman hurled her Malali Indian and African guerrilla troops against European soldiers. </p><p> Throughout the Americas Africans were welcomed into Native American villages as sisters and brothers. Often enslaved together, red people and black people commonly united to seek freedom. "The Indians escaped first and then, since they knew the forest, they came back and liberated the Africans," writes anthropologist Richard Price about the origins of the Saramaka people of Suriname in the 1680s. He is describing an American frontier tradition as old as Thanksgiving. </p><p> A Native American adoption system that had no racial barriers recruited black men and women in the battle against encroaching Europeans. Artist George Catlin described "Negro and North American Indian, mixed, of equal blood" as being "the finest built and most powerful men I have ever yet seen." </p><p> Before 1700 maroons were generally ruled by Africans, but after that they were more likely to be governed by children of African-Native American marriages. Carter G. Woodson, father of modern black history, called this racial mixture "one of the longest unwritten chapters in the history of the United States." In the 1920s research at Columbia University by anthropologist Melvin J. Herskovits proved that one in every three African-Americans had an Indian branch in their family tree. </p><p> Beginning with a Jamestown, Virginia battle in 1622 whites complained "the Indians murdered every white but saved the Negroes." Charleston's Colonel Stephen Bull urged division of the races in order to "Establish a hatred between Negroes and Indians." Europeans prevented their meetings and marriages, ended enslavement of Indians and introduced African slavery to the Five Civilized Nations, the Cherokees, Chickasaws, Choctaws, Creeks and Seminoles. But John Bartram found Indian slavery was so gentle it permitted slaves to marry masters and find "freedom...and an equality." </p><p> "We make Indians and Negroes a checque upon each other lest by their Vastly Superior Numbers we should be crushed by one or the other," stated Reverend Richard Ludlam. Native Americans were hired or bribed to hunt slave runaways, and slaves were armed to fight Native Americans. When local nations refused, fighters from distant regions were hired. </p><p> But the white lid never closed shut. In 1721 the Governor of Virginia made the Five Nations promise to return all runaways; in 1726 the Governor of New York had the Iroquois Confederacy promise; in 1746 the Hurons promised and the next year the Delawares promised. None ever returned a slave. </p><p> To the consternation of slaveholders, two dark peoples began to unite as allies and family from the Atlantic westward. </p><p> <i>Stephen Dorantes or Estevan</i> </p><p> The first African whose name appears in the historical chronicles of the New World was an explorer of many skills, though he lived and died a slave. Estevan, born in Azamore, Morocco, at the turn of the fifteenth century, was the servant of Andres Dorantes and has variously been called Estevanico, Stephen Dorantes or Esteban. On June 17, 1527, in San Lucas de Barrameda, Spain, he and his master boarded a ship for the New World. Estevan was then about thirty and possibly no more than his master's manservant. Both were part of a five-hundred-man expedition to explore the northern shore of the Gulf of Mexico, an assignment authorized by King Charles I and headed by his newly commissioned governor of Florida, P�nfilo de Narv�ez. In all probability Estevan was not the only African in the party; but he became the first to shape the course of history both for people living in the New World and European newcomers. </p><p> On April 14, 1528, the Narv�ez expedition landed in Florida, probably at Sarasota Bay, and began its planned exploration. Almost immediately it floundered on a combination of inept management and natural calamities and its numbers were steadily reduced through starvation, desertions and even cannibalism. In one Indian village, which they would later rename "Misfortune Island," through disease the party dwindled from eighty to fifteen. Finally only four were left, Estevan, his master and two other whites. All four were soon enslaved by Indian tribes. During a semiannual Indian gathering the four met and, like slaves anywhere, began plotting their escape. At the next Indian gathering the three white and one black slave escaped together, plunging westward along the Gulf Coast. </p><p> The only record of the years of wandering was later recorded by Alvar N��ez Cabeza de Vaca, their leader. He told how the four managed to get along with Indian tribes by posing as medicine men, using the sign of the cross, Christian prayers and incantations, and some efforts at minor surgery. Estevan, Cabeza de Vaca noted, "was our go-between; he informed himself about the ways we wished to take, what towns there were, and the matters we desired to know." In 1536, eight years after the Narv�ez party had landed in Florida, its four sole survivors reached Spanish headquarters in Mexico. </p><p> The three white men left for Spain, Andres Dorantes selling Estevan to Antonio de Mendoza, viceroy of New Spain. Estevan's stories, embellished from Indian tales about Cibola or "The Seven Cities of Gold," enthralled his Spanish listeners, particularly when he produced some metal objects to demonstrate that smelting was an art known in Cibola. </p><p> In 1539 Governor Mendoza selected Father Marcos de Niza, an Italian priest, to lead an expedition to Cibola. Estevan was the logical choice for his guide. The African was sent ahead with several Indians and two huge greyhounds, and instructed to send back wooden crosses whose size would indicate his nearness to his goal. Estevan again decided to pose as a medicine man, this time carrying a large gourd decorated with strings of bells and a red and white feather. Soon many Indians were drawn to the party of this mysterious black man. And one by one huge white crosses began to arrive in Father Marcos's camp, carried by Estevan's Indian guides, who also reported that the African's entourage had swelled to three hundred and he was being showered with jewelry. There was also the evidence of the crosses: each was larger than the last, and every few days another arrived. Father Marcos issued orders to hasten the march to Estevan and Cibola. </p><p> <i>Father de Niza Sends Estevan Ahead</i> </p><p> So the sayde Stephan departed from mee on Passion-sunday after dinner: and within foure dayes after the messengers of Stephan returned unto me with a great Crosse as high as a man, and they brought me word from Stephan, that I should forthwith come away after him, for bee had found people which gave him information of a very mighty Province, and that he had sent me one of the said Indians. This Indian told me, that it was thirtie dayes journey from the Towne where Stephan was, unto the first Citie of the sayde Province, which is called Ceuola. Hee affirmed also that there are seven great Cities in this Province, all under one Lord, the houses whereof are made of Lyme and Stone, and are very great....<br> Father Marcos de Niza in Richard Hakluyt, <i>Hakluyt's Collection of the Early Voyages, Travels, and Discoveries of the English Nation</i> (London, 1810) </p><p> But no further word came from Estevan. Weeks later two wounded Indians arrived and told Father Marcos of Estevan's capture and the massacre of the entire expedition just as they were about to enter an Indian village. Their report concluded, "We could not see Stephen any more, and we think they have shot him to death, as they have done all the rest which went with him, so that none are escaped but we only." </p><p> Estevan's story does not end with his death. He was the first non-Indian to explore Arizona and New Mexico and the stories and legends of his journey stimulated the explorations of Coronado and de Soto. </p><p> <i>The Death of Estevan</i> </p><p> These wounded Indians I asked for Stephan, and they...sayd, that after they had put him into the...house without giving him meat or drinke all that day and all that night, they took from Stephan all the things which hee carried with him. The next day when the Sunne was a lance high, Stephan went out of the house [and suddenly saw a crowd of people coming at him from the city,] whom as soone as hee sawe he began to run away and we likewise, and foorthwith they shot at us and wounded us, and certain men fell dead upon us...and after this we could not see Stephan any more, and we thinke they have shot him to death, as they have done all the rest which went with him, so that none are escaped but we onely.<br> Father Marcos de Niza in Richard Hakluyt, <i>Hakluyt's Collection of the Early Voyages, Travels, and Discoveries of the English Nation</i> (London, 1810) </p><p> <i>Estevan Becomes a Zuni Legend</i> </p><p> It is to be believed that a long time ago, when roofs lay over the walls of Kyaki-me, then the Black Mexicans came from their abodes in Everlasting Summerland. Then the Indians of So-no-li set up a great howl, and thus they and our ancients did much ill to one another. Then and thus was killed by our ancients, right where the stone stands down by the arroyo of Kya-ki-me, one of the Black Mexicans, a large man, with chilli lips.<br> Cited by Monroe W. Work, <i>The Negro Year Book,</i> 1925 </p><p> Estevan also lived on in a Zuni legend which told of a brave black man who had entered their village and had been slain. Though no one ever found the Seven Cities of Gold, the belief in their existence and the search for them not only led to exploration of the entire American Southwest, but gave the newcomers from abroad the material they would shape into the first great American folk myth. That an African slave should first search the New World for a mythical land of wealth and comfort is symbolic of the black experience in America. </p><p> <i>Jean Ba...</i></p></p><h2>Hammond Atlas of the Bible Lands</h2><p>The stories of the Bible come to life with this authoritative, richly illustrated, four-color atlas.

Now, almost seventy years later, Harold Innis's fundamental reinterpretation of Canadian history continues to exert a magnetic influence.</p><p>Innis has long been regarded as one of Canada's foremost historians, and in The Fur Trade in Canada he presents several histories in one: social history through the clash between colonial and aboriginal cultures; economic history in the development of the West as a result of Eastern colonial and European needs; and transportation history in the case of the displacement of the canoe by the York boat. Political history appears in Innis's examination of the nature of French-British rivalry and the American Revolution; and business history is represented in his detailed account of the Hudson's Bay and Northwest Companies and the industry that played so vital a role in the expansion of Canada.</p><p>In his introduction to this new edition, Arthur J. Ray argues that <i>The Fur Trade in Canada</i> is the most definitive economic history and geography of the country ever produced. Innis's revolutionary conclusion - that Canada was created because of its geography, not in spite of it - is a captivating idea but also an enigmatic proposition in light of the powerful decentralizing forces that threaten the nation today. Ray presents the history of the book and concludes that "Innis's great book remains essential reading for the study of Canada."</p></p><p><strong>Harold A.

It began with ephemeral enhancements or traces left in deserted landscapes, in the deserts of America, or in the moors of Scotland. Following this were spectacular earthen sculptures of gigantic proportions, some of which are still in the process of completion today. One distinguishing feature of Land Art is its critical preoccupation with the tradition of sculpture. Sculpture can now be an earthwork excavation, a field of metal poles, a buried hut, a trace in the grass, or even a book.

J. Brody here returns to his early work on the Mimbres ceramic tradition, which established him as the leading authority on the arts of this ancient people. The Mimbres cultural florescence between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1140 remains one of the most visually astonishing and anthropologically intriguing questions in Southwest prehistory. In this revised edition, Dr. Brody incorporates the extensive fieldwork done on Mimbres sites since the original publication in 1977, updating his discussion of village life, the larger world in which the Mimbres people lived, and how the art that they practiced illuminates these wider issues. He addresses human and animal iconography, the importance of perspective and motion in perceiving Mimbres artistry, and the technology used to produce the ceramics. Placing the study of ancient art and artifacts in the present, he notes the impact of the antiquities market on archaeological and artistic research. This lively, engaging work will interest archaeologists, art historians, and all people who enjoy the beauty, humor, and humanity of Mimbres pottery. Featuring over one hundred new illustrations and insights drawn from a lifetime of study and contemplation, this is much more than a revised edition. Indeed, it establishes a new standard for the artistic interpretation of a classic Southwestern culture for the new century.</p><p>J.J.

Ahead was the Crazy Z Bar Ranch. Joe was there<br>to deliver bad news to the ranch manager.<br><br>It was Saturday in early September during the two-week period<br>between the end of summer in the high country and preceding<br>hunting season openers. The morning had started off<br>with the bite of fall but had warmed by the hour. The groves of<br>aspens in the mountains were already turning gold, although<br>the cottonwoods flanking both sides of the river still held green<br>and full. The river was down but still floatable, and upriver in<br>the distance he caught a glimpse of a low-profile McKenzie-style<br>drift boat rounding a bend. The guide manned the oars, and<br>fly-fishermen clients cast from the front and back of the boat,<br>long sweeps of fly-line catching the sun, toward a deep seam<br>near the far bank.<br><br>He held his breath as he did every time he drove across. There<br>were gaps between the two-by-eights that made up the surface<br>of the bridge and he could see glimpses of the river flash by<br>through his open driver&#x2019;s-side window. The bridge itself was<br>over forty-five years old and constructed of steel girders held<br>together by bolts. Auburn tears of rust flowed down the surface<br>of the steel and pooled in the channels of the I-beams, which<br>had long ago inspired a local fishing guide to deem it &#x201c;the<br>Bridge of Cries.&#x201d; It stuck.<br><br>Out of view beneath the bridge hung a large metal hand-<br>painted sign:<br>THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY<br>FISHERMEN, STAY IN YOUR BOAT<br>VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTED<br>BY THE CRAZY Z BAR RANCH<br>Joe knew from experience they weren&#x2019;t kidding. Even that<br>time in high water when a raft filled with Boy Scouts capsized<br>on the swells and rocks. Eight sodden but uninjured Scouts and<br>their two Scoutmasters&#x2014;one with a broken arm&#x2014;had found<br>the ranch headquarters at dusk. The former manager, following<br>standing orders from the owner, loaded them all into the bed of<br>his three-quarter-ton pickup and drove them to the Saddlestring<br>jail to press charges.<br><br>The absentee owner of the ranch, Lamar Dietrich of St.<br>Louis, had the signs put up when he bought the ranch. He<br>meant what he said and played for keeps. And he wouldn&#x2019;t be<br>happy at all, Joe knew, to hear why Joe had come.<br><br>Daisy, Joe&#x2019;s two-year-old Labrador, raised her head from<br>where she slept on the passenger seat to stare at the Angus cattle<br>that grazed on the side of the dirt road. She was fascinated with<br>cows, and Joe wondered if in Daisy&#x2019;s mind cows appeared to her<br>as very large black dogs. A tremulous whine came from deep in<br>her throat.<br><br>&#x201c;Settle down,&#x201d; Joe said, navigating a turn and plunging his<br>truck through a thin spring creek that crossed the road. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t<br>even think about chasing them.&#x201d;<br><br>Daisy looked over at him with a puzzled expression.<br><br>&#x201c;Chasing Dietrich&#x2019;s cattle is a death sentence. He&#x2019;s had dogs<br>shot for it. I want to keep you around for a while.&#x201d;<br><br>Daisy lowered her head.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got a big binder he calls The Book of Rules that sits on a<br>table in the foreman&#x2019;s house,&#x201d; Joe said to Daisy. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen it, and<br>it&#x2019;s thick. He expects every one of his ranch managers to memorize<br>it, and he has tabs for every conceivable circumstance and<br>how they&#x2019;re supposed to deal with it. He&#x2019;s got tabs on trespassing<br>and road improvement and cattle management and fifty or<br>so other tabs on everything he can think of. If the ranch manager<br>makes a decision that isn&#x2019;t covered in The Book of Rules,<br>that manager doesn&#x2019;t stay around very long. There&#x2019;s a tab on<br>stray dogs. They&#x2019;re to be shot on sight so they don&#x2019;t run his<br>cattle.<br><br>&#x201c;So keep your head down, especially if Dietrich is around,&#x201d;<br>Joe said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s just plain mean.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe had met Dietrich two times over the years, and both<br>encounters were unpleasant. The old man was in his late seventies<br>and appeared shorter than he actually was because his back<br>was stooped and his shoulders slumped forward. Because of the<br>deformity, his head was always down and when he looked up<br>his eyes appeared menacing. His voice was a low soft growl and<br>he didn&#x2019;t waste words. He had no time or respect for local officials,<br>state game wardens, or incompetent ranch foremen.<br><br>Joe had heard that Dietrich had amassed his fortune by<br>negotiating cutthroat deals with urban governments for waste<br>management services. There were thousands of distinctive red-<br>and-yellow Dietrich Waste Management trucks throughout the<br>inner cities of the Rust Belt and the northeastern states. He&#x2019;d<br>taken on local political machines and organized crime families<br>to secure long-term contracts. Then, like so many extremely<br>wealthy men in America, he had looked around for a safe haven<br>for his cash and opted to sink some of it in real estate and had<br>chosen to buy massive ranches in the West, including this one<br>in Wyoming. The Crazy Z Bar, with tens of thousands of acres<br>of mountainous terrain, pastureland, sagebrush flats, and fifteen<br>premium miles of the Twelve Sleep River snaking through<br>it. The purchase price, Joe had heard, was $22.5 million.<br><br>The first time Joe met Dietrich was when the then-foreman<br>of the ranch, under orders from the owner, had strung bar bed<br>wire across the river to stop the passage of local fishing<br>guides and recreational floaters. Joe had explained that state law<br>allowed access to all navigable waters, that the land itself was<br>private&#x2014;even the river bottom itself&#x2014;but the water was public.<br>As long as the boaters didn&#x2019;t anchor or step out of their boat,<br>they could legally cross the ranch. Dietrich exploded and ordered<br>his then-foreman to beat up Joe right there and then. The<br>foreman refused, and was fired. Joe filed charges against Dietrich<br>for threatening him, but dropped them when Dietrich<br>agreed to remove his barbed-wire fence.<br><br>The second time, just two months ago, Joe was at a hearing<br>before the Game and Fish Commission on a plan Dietrich proposed<br>to convert two thousand acres of his ranch into a wild<br>game hunting operation. Dietrich&#x2019;s idea was to import water<br>buffalo, gazelles, kudu, blackbuck, and scimitar-horned oryx<br>from Africa to be hunted by his friends. Since Joe was the local<br>game warden, he was asked to testify, and he testified against<br>the plan. Exotic, non-native species were a threat to the antelope,<br>deer, and elk populations, he had said, and there was no<br>way for Dietrich to guarantee the animals would never escape or<br>pass along diseases that could decimate local wildlife. Dietrich<br>appeared briefly at the hearing and extended a crooked finger at<br>Joe and called him &#x201c;a no-account tinhorn jackbooted thug.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe said: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been called that before.&#x201d;<br><br>Because the atmosphere in the hearing room was so poisonous,<br>the commission chose to take the decision under advisement<br>and issue a ruling at a future date.<br><br>That date had arrived. They had voted no. And Joe was<br>tasked with delivering the verdict to the new ranch manager of<br>the Crazy Z Bar, the Dietrich employee who had drafted and<br>presented the proposal, Kyle Sandford.<br><br>Poor Kyle, Joe thought.<br><br>Although Lamar Dietrich&#x2019;s magnificent empty home&#x2014;<br>built of native stone and sheets of glass so heavy and large that<br>they&#x2019;d been delivered by a cargo helicopter&#x2014;was set into the<br>side of the mountain that overlooked the river bottom, the manager&#x2019;s<br>house was humble and in need of paint and new shingles.<br>It was located on a sagebrush shelf with a cluster of outbuildings<br>including a metal barn, corrals, and a Quonset hut for housing<br>vehicles and machinery.<br><br>There was never any need to knock on the doors of ranch<br>homes, and no way to sneak onto a ranch. Daisy perked up<br>again when a gaggle of motley ranch dogs boiled out from pools<br>of shade and streaked toward Joe&#x2019;s pickup. They formed yipping,<br>tumbling knots on both sides and accompanied him as he<br>drove into the ranch yard, nipping at the tires and fenders, the<br>cacophony signaling the arrival of a stranger.<br><br>&#x201c;You stay,&#x201d; Joe said to Daisy over the racket.<br><br>The three members of the Sandford family appeared from<br>three different places in the ranch yard as if joining each other<br>on a stage: Joleen came from the ranch house itself, drying her<br>hands on a dish towel; Kyle Sr. looked out from the Quonset,<br>gripping a Crescent wrench with an oily hand; and Kyle Jr.<br>strolled from a pocket of willows that marked the bank of the<br>river, his fly rod poking nine feet into the air.<br><br>Joe was most familiar with Kyle Jr., who was seventeen and<br>ran in the same circle as his ward, April. He was a quiet ranch<br>kid who had boarded the same bus as other ranch kids until<br>he could drive himself, but hadn&#x2019;t been in the valley long<br>enough&#x2014;and wasn&#x2019;t an outstanding athlete, scholar, or leader&#x2014;<br>to belong firmly to a pack. He seemed like a floater, the kind of<br>boy who hung back and to the side, keeping his mouth shut,<br>occasionally surprising others with a good quip or an observation,<br>but was never missed when he didn&#x2019;t show up and never<br>mentioned when groups were forming to attend games, go out<br>on Friday nights, or plan a party. Joe recalled April reviewing<br>digital photos of her friends at a football game, pointing out<br>characters and laughing about things they&#x2019;d done or said. When<br>she came across a photo of Kyle Sandford Jr., she shook her head<br>and said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember him being there, but I guess he was.&#x201d;<br><br>Kyle Jr. was wiry and dark with a prominent Adam&#x2019;s apple<br>and wispy sideburns. Joe had never seen the boy smile, but he<br>had eyes that seemed to carefully take everything in.<br><br>Kyle Sr. nodded a reserved hello to Joe and Joe nodded back.<br>Joleen withdrew into the house but stood behind the screen,<br>watching carefully. Kyle Sr. tossed his wrench into a bucket of<br>tools behind him, clamped on a dirty short-brimmed Stetson<br>Rancher, and greeted Joe by saying, &#x201c;Joe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Kyle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did you bring me some good news?&#x201d;<br><br>Joe paused. &#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br><br>Kyle Sr. took a deep breath and stood still. His face betrayed<br>nothing, but Joe saw Joleen shake her head behind the screen<br>and turn away.<br><br>&#x201c;It was unanimous,&#x201d; Joe said. &#x201c;The commission voted to not<br>allow a game farm. They said it would be a bad precedent, even<br>if your owner did all the security fencing and inoculations he<br>said he would.&#x201d;<br><br>Kyle Sr. said nothing. He just stared at Joe and his mouth got<br>tight.<br><br>Finally, in a thin voice, he said, &#x201c;Is there anything we can do<br>about this?&#x201d;<br><br>Joe was puzzled. Was Kyle Sr. offering a bribe?<br><br>&#x201c;Like what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Make another run at &#x2019;em, maybe. Adjust the proposal so<br>they&#x2019;re happy about it this time, you know?&#x201d;<br><br>Joe shook his head. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll meet again in a month, but I<br>can&#x2019;t see them changing their minds.&#x201d;<br><br>Kyle Sr. dropped his head and stared at the top of his boots.<br>&#x201c;You know what&#x2019;s going to happen then, right?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m guessing Lamar Dietrich won&#x2019;t be too happy,&#x201d; Joe said.<br><br>Kyle Sr. snorted and said, &#x201c;You got that right. But you know<br>what else will happen?&#x201d;<br><br>Joe said he didn&#x2019;t.<br><br>&#x201c;Come with me,&#x201d; Kyle Sr. said, gesturing with his chin toward<br>the house. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll show you something.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe started forward and remembered Kyle Jr. He looked over<br>at the boy as he passed by. &#x201c;Any luck?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re hitting on prince nymphs and scuds.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Any size to &#x2019;em?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Eighteen, nineteen inches,&#x201d; Kyle Jr. said. &#x201c;I broke off one<br>that was bigger than that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nice fish,&#x201d; Joe said, impressed.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Kyle Jr. said, his eyes worried, &#x201c;they were.&#x201d;<br><br>Inside, Kyle Sr. pointed toward The Book of Rules and Joe<br>knew then what was coming. The man slid the binder across<br>the counter and used a greasy thumb to find the right tab. Joe<br>read it: local political influence.<br><br>Kyle Sr. folded back the tab to the first page of the section,<br>and read:<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;As Ranch Manager of the Crazy Z Bar, an important part of<br>your responsibilities is to develop influential working relationships<br>with officials on the county and state level. The purpose of<br>these relationships is to further the goals of the property and implement<br>projects deemed important by the owner. Failure to secure<br>beneficial results and decisions may result in termination.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Joe contemplated that.<br><br>Kyle Sr. said, &#x201c;Mr. Dietrich thinks anything is possible if<br>you&#x2019;ve got the right relationships with the powers that be. That&#x2019;s<br>how he got to be such a rich man. He thinks all his managers<br>need to have that same ability. I guess I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that,&#x201d; Joe said. &#x201c;I was at the hearing, remember?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you testified against us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I did. But it wasn&#x2019;t because the proposal was sloppy or<br>you weren&#x2019;t a good man making a strong bid. The game farm<br>was rejected on its merits. It would have been the only game<br>farm in the whole state, and policy was against you from the<br>start. I think we have a lot of stupid policies, but that isn&#x2019;t one of<br>them. No one wants to be out elk hunting and run into a water<br>buffalo. Simple as that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Kyle Sr. said softly. &#x201c;But that won&#x2019;t matter to Mr.<br>Dietrich. He&#x2019;ll see it as me being a piss-poor influencer of<br>mucky-mucks. He won&#x2019;t look at the big picture and see how I&#x2019;ve<br>made our cattle operation go into the black or how I&#x2019;ve sold<br>more hay than any other manager here over the years. He&#x2019;ll look<br>at this tab and cut me loose.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe said, &#x201c;He can&#x2019;t be that unreasonable.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know him like I do,&#x201d; Kyle Sr. said, shaking his<br>head. &#x201c;If someone doesn&#x2019;t do the job he wants, he cuts &#x2019;em loose.<br>Haven&#x2019;t you ever wondered why this place has gone through six<br>managers in fifteen years? I&#x2019;ve stuck the longest&#x2014;going on four<br>years. But he&#x2019;ll find out about this decision and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Joe looked up when Kyle Sr. suddenly stopped talking to see<br>what had stopped him. He followed the man&#x2019;s eyes to the outside<br>screen door, where Kyle Jr. stood on the porch.<br><br>Joe understood. No father wanted his son to think of him as<br>a failure, whether the circumstances were fair or not.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re talking,&#x201d; Kyle Sr. said to Kyle Jr.<br><br>&#x201c;Are we gonna have to move again?&#x201d; the boy asked.<br><br>Kyle Sr. raised his voice and said, &#x201c;I said we&#x2019;re talking in here,<br>son. I don&#x2019;t need you standing there listening in. You go get the<br>company truck and gas it up. You can take it into town.&#x201d;<br><br>Kyle Jr. looked back, uncomprehending. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Because Mr. Dietrich is coming for his quarterly visit. You<br>can pick him up and bring him out here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why me?&#x201d; Kyle Jr. asked, pain in his eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Because your mother and me need to start packing up,&#x201d;<br>Kyle Sr. said.<br><br>From the living room, out of sight, Joe heard Joleen gasp.<br><br>To her, Kyle Sr. said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be getting what you always<br>wanted, Joleen.&#x201d;<br><br>She responded with a choked mewl.<br><br>To Joe, he said as an aside, &#x201c;She never liked this place, anyhow.<br>She&#x2019;s scared of Dietrich and she&#x2019;d like to be closer to her<br>people in Idaho. Maybe we&#x2019;ll end up there now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about Kyle Junior?&#x201d; Joe asked, after the boy had left<br>the porch.<br><br>&#x201c;He loves this place,&#x201d; he said with a heavy sigh. &#x201c;He thought<br>we&#x2019;d finally found a place for him where we could stay awhile.<br>He&#x2019;s made some friends and he&#x2019;s finally getting...</p><h2>Jerome: His Life, Writings, and Controversies</h2><p>Jerome was to medieval biblical and historical scholarship what his contemporary Augustine was to medieval theology: a founding father whose works were revered for centuries. His knowledge of Greek and Hebrew equipped him to produce the Vulgate, the Latin version that was the official Bible of the Catholic church until recent decades.

For months, without time to rest and regroup, my friend, herself nearing the end of a fatal illness and keeping it from her mother, had managed a series of medical and home care emergencies. She was running on empty.<br><br>The second friend, rocked by the financial strains and childrearing conflicts that often follow divorce, had largely abdicated to his siblings the demands of long-distance supervision of two increasingly disabled parents, one lost in the fog of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and the other plagued by stress pain and the broken bones of osteoporosis. When my friend tried to do his fair share of the work, he was overwhelmed. When he didn&#x2019;t try, he was conscience-stricken.<br><br>The third friend was considering making a cross-country move to be closer to his mother, who was then past ninety and losing her customary verve. Driving had become risky, and her once-daily walks to the store or the library were just too much sometimes, now that simply dressing or preparing meals took so much energy. My friend knew his mother needed more from him than three-times-a-day phone calls. And he wanted more from her as their time together dwindled.<br><br>Before that day was over, I had also spoken to each friend&#x2019;s mother, as I do regularly, since all of them are dear to me. What they had to say, unbidden, was the flip side of my earlier conversations with their children. These three strong-willed old women were grateful for their children&#x2019;s devotion but resistant to giving up the reins. They were embarrassed by their own diminished capacity and frightened of what lay ahead, but nothing was worse, they said, than being a burden. Like my mother, who died in 2003, they fought dependence, even as it became inevitable.<br><br>All of my conversations served as a fitting reminder that we stand at an unprecedented demographic crossroads. Never before have there been so many Americans over the age of eighty-five. Never before have there been so many Americans in late middle age, the huge baby boom cohort, responsible for their parents&#x2019; health and well-being. Most often, neither the aged parents nor the adult children are prepared for this long, oft en tortured, time in life, or for these role reversals, which are unanticipated, unwelcome, and unfamiliar. How do we become our parents&#x2019; parents without robbing them of their dignity? How do they let us? How do we collaborate with our siblings, leaving behind any baggage we may have with them, or manage on our own if we are only children?<br><br>The task is to get through it with grace, mindfulness, and good sense: to do the very best we can for our parents without sacrificing the lives we&#x2019;ve built for ourselves&#x2014;our families, our jobs, and our own fi nancial future, which is the last thing they&#x2019;d want us to do. But how do we know when it&#x2019;s still appropriate to aggressively pursue medical care, try to fix everything that&#x2019;s broken, and restore our parents to a measure of health, vitality, and dignity? How do we know when, logistically and financially, we must break a solemn promise not to &#x201c;put them away&#x201d; (and how do we forgive ourselves for doing it, if we must)? How do we know when the time for heroics has passed? Our parents may have escaped earlier threats to their health&#x2014;strokes, cardiac events, cancer&#x2014;and lived longer than any generation before them, but eventually some things are just going to wear out. Their death certificates will say they died of heart failure or diabetic complications or respiratory failure, because the government has decreed that &#x201c;old age&#x201d; is not an acceptable cause of death. I beg to differ. At a certain point, the wheels simply fall off the bicycle.<br><br>So here we are, not just with a herculean job but with a front-row seat for this long, slow dying. We want to do all we realistically can to ease the suff ering, smooth the passing, of our loved ones. But we also have the opportunity to watch what happens to our parents, listen to what they have to say to us, and use that information to look squarely at our own mortality and prepare as best we can for the end of our own lives. In fact, we have the opportunity to become better people, wiser and stronger, not simply older and grayer. We can make something of this crisis, or we can endure the experience until it&#x2019;s over and then escape back into the daily buzz of our lives until suddenly it&#x2019;s our turn.<br><br>That is what this book is about: how we get through this time, no matter how long it lasts. It is written from the far shore of caregiving, an allconsuming and life-altering experience that wrings you out, uses you up, and then sends you back into the world with your heart full and your eyes open, if you let it. First and foremost it is my own story&#x2014;mine, my mother&#x2019;s, and my brother&#x2019;s&#x2014;the one I know best. But it will be amplified and enriched, at every turn, by the people I&#x2019;ve interviewed on this subject over the years as part of my job for <i>The New York Times</i>&#x2014;the elderly, their adult children, professionals in the fi eld&#x2014;and more recently by the hundreds of thousands of monthly readers of the blog I launched for the Times, called<i> The New Old Age</i>, the first such forum for two intersecting generations finding their way through a timeless challenge but never before experienced in these daunting new ways or in these numbers.<br>Although my caregiving days are behind me, they are vivid still. In the space of three years, between 2000 and 2003, my mother&#x2019;s ferocious independence gave way to utter reliance on her two adult children. Garden-variety aches and pains became major health problems; halfh earted attention no longer sufficed, and managing her needs from afar became impossible. The time had come for my mother&#x2019;s reverse migration, from a retirement community in Florida to another in New York, and in short order to a nursing home. By the end of her life, at eighty-eight, she was paralyzed, incontinent, could not speak, was losing the ability to swallow, and wanted nothing so much as a dignifi ed way to die.<br><br>Those are the bare-bones facts. Missing is the panic of being in charge; and the shock to my brother, Michael, and me when our competence and resources proved all but useless in the face of America&#x2019;s incoherent and inadequate safety net for the frail elderly. We were flattened by the enormous demands on our time, energy, and bank accounts; the disruption to our professional and personal lives; the fear that our time in this parallel universe would never end and the guilt for wishing that it would. I can tell you now that it was worth every dreadful minute, a transformative experience. But at the time, living in the eternal present tense, all we could manage was muddling from one day to the next.<br><br>My brother and I were late children, so we reached this juncture before our friends and colleagues, who, innocent of experience, telegraphed the belief, painful to us, that we were exaggerating how awful it was. Only occasionally did they say it out loud, but in the silence between sentences I could hear judgment: <i>This can&#x2019;t be as hard as you&#x2019;re making it sound. Old people get sick and die all the time. This isn&#x2019;t your child, or your spouse, or yourself. It&#x2019;s inevitable.</i><br><br>It was a lonely time. I was too tired and too sad for socially appropriate chitchat; I emptied the room at cocktail parties with gloom-and-doom stories nobody wanted to hear and quickly found it easier to just stay home. My brother, luckily, seemed to cross more easily between these disparate worlds in which we found ourselves.<br><br>At work, I tried to keep pace with my job while fi elding my mother&#x2019;s incessant phone calls, chasing down doctors, phoning in prescriptions, hiring geriatric care managers and aides, arguing with my brother, fighting back tears, and dashing out of the newsroom for emergencies. Had I been a parent, I might have been just as stressed, but part of my energies would have been invested in a child&#x2019;s bright future. Old people may have good days, and it was my job to maximize those for my mother, but they don&#x2019;t have bright futures.<br><br>Among my somewhat younger friends and colleagues, the fear and confusion I remember has now become commonplace. I hear it from behind the partitioned cubicles at work, in weary discussions on the train platform or in the supermarket checkout line, at business meetings with people I barely know. A total stranger confides his feelings of guilt at letting his sister do all the heavy lift ing. Another, ashamed, says he recoiled when shaving his father for the fi rst time. A third is at her wit&#x2019;s end because her parents, usually frugal coupon clippers, have for months been paying rent at an assisted living facility but still refuse to leave their home. A fourth cannot aff ord home care for his mother and wants her to end her days in his house but wonders at the eff ect on his children.<br><br>The same day that I tried to console my three friends, and their mothers, I had an appointment with my internist, who spent half the visit telling me about her mother&#x2019;s ups and downs since her move to a continuing care retirement community. When I spoke to my literary agent, whose father was in failing health and would die within months, she was passing the caregiver&#x2019;s baton to her brother on the eve of an overseas vacation. Colleagues wanted to know the cost of a home health aide, an explanation as to why adult diapers fit women better than men, and product reviews for medical alert pendants and staircase chair-lifts. I also bumped into a neighbor w...</p><h2>Cristina Iglesias: Metonymy</h2><p>This book will survey the broad range of Cristina Iglesias&#x2019;s work from its beginnings in the mid-1980s until the present. In addition to focusing on sculptures made for museum and gallery contexts, it will reference Iglesias&#x2019;s various and much acclaimed public pieces, and the accompanying video series, the &#x201c;Guided Tours.&#x201d; The exhibition, which includes models, drawings, and sketchbooks, will trace the evolution and realization of several ambitious site specific projects. In addition, it will present a comprehensive overview of Iglesias&#x2019;s silk-screen works on both copper and cloth. Examining the substantial contribution that Iglesias has made to sculpture as a contemporary art form, both public and private, the book&#x2019;s five essays focus on a variety of key subjects: Iglesias&#x2019;s way of understanding sculpture as visualized thought; her use of water as a material in sculpture; her references to fine art traditions; dialogues with architecture; and her public commissions.<br><br></p><p>Lynne Cooke is Andrew W.

In <i>Dangerous Ambition,</i> Susan Hertog chronicles the separate but intertwined journeys of these two remarkable women writers, who achieved unprecedented fame and influence at tremendous personal cost.<br> &nbsp;<br> American Dorothy Thompson was the first female head of a European news bureau, a columnist and commentator with a tremendous following whom <i>Time</i> magazine once ranked alongside Eleanor Roosevelt as the most influential woman in America. Rebecca West, an Englishwoman at home wherever genius was spoken, blazed a trail for herself as a journalist, literary critic, novelist, and historian. In a prefeminist era when speaking truth to power could get anyone&#x2014;of either gender&#x2014;ostracized, blacklisted, or worse, these two smart, self-made women were among the first to warn the world about the dangers posed by fascism, communism, and appeasement.<br> &nbsp;<br> But there was a price to be paid, Hertog shows, for any woman aspiring to such greatness. As much as they sought voice and power in the public forum of opinion and ideas, and the independence of mind and money that came with them, Thompson and West craved the comforts of marriage and home. Torn between convention and the opportunities of the new postwar global world, they were drawn to men who were as ambitious and hungry for love as themselves: Thompson to the brilliant, volatile, and alcoholic Nobel Prize winner Sinclair Lewis; West to her longtime lover H. G. Wells, the lusty literary eminence whose sexual and emotional demands doomed any chance they may have had at love. Tragically, both arrangements produced troubled sons, whose anger and jealousy at their mothers&#x2019; iconic fame eroded their sense of personal success.<br> &nbsp;<br> Brimming with fresh insights obtained from previously sealed archives, this penetrating dual biography is a story of twinned lives caught up in the crosscurrents of world events and affairs of the heart&#x2014;and of the unique trans-Atlantic friendship forged by two of the most creative and complex women of their time.</p><p><b>Susan Hertog</b> was born in New York City and graduated from Hunter College.

Why, now in time of sunny dawn, Why should your faith so sudden fade.<br><br>&#x2014;�Cicely Fairfield, age eight<br><br>London, 1901<br><br>In late October 1901, Charles Fairfield abandoned his wife, Isabella, and their three daughters in the dark of night. Cicely was eight years old; her eldest sister, Letitia, called Lettie, was sixteen; and Winifred, or Winnie, was thirteen. Isabella, forty-�eight years old and with nothing but memories of a thwarted music career, was left penniless. Charles had gambled away their money, absconded with hidden cash, and left them not only to dig themselves out of debt, but also to bear the shame of penury and social ostracism. Neither his wife nor his family would see Charles alive again.<br><br>Those were the facts. The myths came later, and as time passed they kept on changing, depending on Cicely&#x2019;s turn of mind and emotional needs. She was too young to feel anything but sadness and confusion, but her instinct was that she had lost a kindred soul&#x2014;�a piece of herself. Through the years, she would see her father as a person who meant everything and nothing&#x2014;�a principled thinker and a skilled polemicist, an ideal man and a role model, and someone whose perfidy infected the sinews of her life with feverous distortions and unbearable pain. While she would search for him in her relationships with men, in her own way, she set out to become him.<br><br>As a woman in her seventies, still trying to make sense of an event that had occurred more than six decades earlier, Rebecca, n�e Cicely Fairfield, a skilled storyteller with a penchant for molding the contours of her past to her own ends, recounted the story of her father&#x2019;s leaving with the romantic nostalgia of a nineteenth-�century child in her book The Fountain Overflows.<br><br>She tells of awakening with her sisters in their second-�story bedroom on a bright and cloudless Saturday morning on the cusp of fall to the sound of windblown trees. As the girls teased and chattered, preparing for a day that was certain to bring adventure after a humdrum week of homework and school, their mother barged into their room wild-�eyed and trembling, letter in hand. In a tragic tone using biblical prose, Rebecca relates her mother&#x2019;s heartbreaking shock as she read aloud her father&#x2019;s words declaring his sudden and hasty departure. She describes a family shattered by confusion and grief&#x2014;�her mother on the brink of a breakdown and her older sisters trying to console her and soothe their baby sister&#x2019;s fears.<br><br>But the reality of the Fairfield family could not have been more different. The marriage of Isabella and Charles had not been amicable for years. In fact, the conception of Cicely had been a failed attempt at reconciliation. They no longer slept in the same bed or shared the same room. Isabella, anticipating her husband&#x2019;s eventual departure, had not informed him of the value of a piece of family art, in the hopes that its sale might cover their debt. But, in fact, Charles&#x2019;s leaving forced her to sell their furniture and the one remnant of her youthful aspiration&#x2014;�her beloved piano.<br><br>Within weeks, Isabella moved the family back to her native Edinburgh and her mother&#x2019;s home.<br><br>The marriage of Isabella Campbell Mackenzie and Charles Fairfield in 1883 had begun well enough. Aboard a ship sailing from Britain to exotic, sun-�drenched Melbourne in Australia, they caught each other&#x2019;s eye as Isabella played the piano one evening after dinner in the salon. Dark-�eyed, delicate, and wistful with auburn hair and porcelain skin, Isabella had long slender fingers that scaled the keyboard with the skill and nuance that attested to a deep spiritual appreciation of music. Thirty years old, on a family goodwill mission to help her ailing brother, Isabella was pleased to be striking out on her own, after too many years of disappointing lovers and the looming prospect of spinsterhood. The dark-�haired and handsome Charles Fairfield, a forty-�one-�year-�old Irishman, harnessed to the charitable task of taking an orphaned boy to his relatives abroad, feigned a love of music to charm the gifted pianist. He seemed a man without past, or at least with one sketchy enough to evoke an air of mystery.<br><br>Three months later they were engaged, and, despite the groom&#x2019;s atheist inclination, they married in December 1883 in an Anglican church whose rose-�stoned spire punctuated the broad Australian sky. Later, Rebecca would describe it as a marriage of &#x201c;loneliness to loneliness.&#x201d;<br><br>Charles, a gifted cartoonist, had secured his first job in Australia drawing for a Melbourne newspaper called The Argus. But his freelance articles proved superior to his caricatures, and he was offered a post as a social, political, and economic commentator with a regular column. Isabella and Charles settled into a small home in St. Kilda, a suburb of Melbourne, near the soft blue sea they had come to love. For two years they lived an idyllic life, wrote Rebecca, touched by the magic of their storybook house and the brilliant Australian sun that streaked the sky indigo and red as evening drew near. Earning a reputation as a fine cook and housekeeper, Isabella spent her evenings with her husband&#x2019;s colleagues and public officials whose views spanned the political spectrum, from socialists to Tory Conservatives to anarchists like Charles. While she didn&#x2019;t relish the constant intrusion and relentless debate, Isabella knew it was her duty to keep her silence.<br><br>Born in Edinburgh in 1853, when married women could neither vote nor own property, Isabella assumed a mask of submission. Careful never to publicly contradict her husband, she was bound to his will by law. But she could no longer hold her tongue as Charles&#x2019;s career as a journalist went sour. Now a practiced orator as well as a columnist, he espoused radical views that alienated his readers and compelled his editor to let him go. With Charles out of work and Isabella no longer silent, the magic of their early years was gone. Grown sick with worry, and pregnant with their third child, Isabella implored Charles to take her home.<br><br>Perhaps it was amid the wrenching chaos of their move back to Britain that Isabella learned the true story of Charles&#x2019;s past, which she later told in whispers to her eldest daughter, Letitia. Until then, Charles had perpetuated a labyrinthine legend worthy of the storyteller he had become. According to him, he had joined the Royal Artillery as an ensign and traveled the world from Canada to Austria, dutifully serving his country until deciding to emigrate to America to fight in the Civil War. Once the war ended, or so he said, he had married a woman in Virginia and fathered a son, then left them to travel west to the woodlands of Colorado. There he had earned his living in a sawmill, biding his time until circumstances provided release in the form of an orphaned boy in need of an escort to Australia. This was history pure fiction, a convoluted attempt of a convicted thief to cover his tracks.<br><br>The real story, uncovered recently by a British scholar, revealed that Charles had indeed served in the Royal Rifle Brigade. But the details depict a man deeply flawed and deceptive. Between the ages of seventeen and twenty-�four, he was posted in Malta and Ontario, and was known to gamble and act in burlesque theater. Lonely and aimless, he went back to his mother&#x2019;s home in London, where he joined the Royal United Service Institute, a think tank that provided companionship and intellectual colloquia, and functioned as a military library and repository of coins and medals.<br><br>In the summer of 1868, having just returned from a disappointing jaunt to America, Charles must have become desperate. The discrepancy between his instinctive sense of intellectual superiority and his lack of social stature and career success prompted him to pursue a plan that would both taint and taunt him for the rest of his life. Dressed for an evening in the West End of London, Charles entered the RUSI and obtained the librarian&#x2019;s key. Beginning in late July and ending seven weeks later on September 22, Charles stole four hundred coins and medals, as well as original copies of Samuel Coleridge&#x2019;s letters, from its cabinets and drawers, each time stashing them in a hatbox that he blithely carried out through the front door. Seemingly without thought to the repercussions or moral implications of his acts, he proceeded to sell the purloined goods to pawnbrokers and goldsmiths throughout the city, leaving a paper trail of receipts and checks.<br><br>Once the administrators discovered that the items were missing, the police easily traced the crime back to him. One evening, when Charles returned to the institution, sporting on his watch chain the finest of the stolen gold coins, he was arrested. In court, his solicitor&#x2019;s plea that Charles had a &#x201c;disordered mind&#x201d; was rejected. Medical officers of the court believed that Charles understood the moral implications of his theft, and he was sentenced to five years of hard labor in a penal institution.<br><br>In prison, Charles&#x2019;s health quickly deteriorated. He had been diagnosed and treated for syphilis while he was in the army, and in the course of physical and psychological testing, prison physicians also discerned a strain of hereditary insanity. Sometime between 1871 and 1872, increasingly weak and malnourished, he was transferred to the Woking Invalid Prison, which functioned both as a hospital and a penitentiary. Charles served his prison term for four years, and then returned to his mother&#x2019;s home in London on a year&#x2019;s probation.<br><br>Charles was now a gaunt thirty-�six-�year-�old, but as handsome as ever. The five years between the end of his prison term and his voyage to Melbourne remain undocumented. It is possible, since Isabella confirmed that he arrived at the dock in Melbourne with a young boy for whom he was responsible, that during these years Charles had returned to America and married, or went directly west to Colorado, where the opportunity to go to Australia was fatefully thrust upon him. It is also possible that the young boy he escorted to relatives was his own son. At this point in time, his whereabouts during these years remain a mystery. But both his marriage to Isabella and their return to En�gland in 1892 are undisputed.<br><br>By the time Cicely was born on December 21, 1892, the Fairfields lived in a shabby Victorian house in Richmond upon Thames, at the outer edges of southwest London. Once neoclassical palaces situated on the hill, the homes were now carved-�up tenements inhabited by the nouveaux riches, mostly upwardly mobile industrialists with a taste for the aristocratic charm of a genteel past. Yet, without efficient trams and trains, Richmond upon Thames had failed to attract more than a handful of residents willing to commute the ten miles into London proper.<br><br>But to those such as the Fairfields, who could not afford to live close to town, the two-�story homes that dipped below the hill were more than adequate. Their squalor was assuaged by access to three thousand acres of unspoiled public parkland. The family took pleasure in ascending the terrace overlooking the valley above the Thames, which flowed westward toward Windsor.</p><h2>Your Life Calling: Reimagining the Rest of Your Life</h2><p>In this inspirational book, beloved broadcast journalist Jane Pauley helps people in the middle of their lives successfully navigate a&#x201c;reinvention&#x201d; phase and build a positive, powerful future.<br><br><b>IN 2014, EVERY BABY BOOMER WILL HAVE REACHED THE MILESTONE AGE OF FIFTY.

This problem is the psychological problem posed by our convictions about fire. It seems to me so definitely psychological in nature that I do not hesitate to speak of a psychoanalysis of fire.&#34; Gaston Bachelard (1884-1962) was a philosopher whose training in the sciences gave him a unique profile in the world of literary criticism to which he turned. An admirer of Husserl and Jung, he was one of the most original and stimulating thinkers of the twentieth century.</p><p>We have only to speak of an object to think that we are being objective.

He was shrieking and pleading, but he wasn't begging for mercy. He'd challenged Death to wrestle with him. He'd thrown back his head and demanded to suffer, as if he wanted the demons to do their worst and drag him down into the pit of Hell. If he was human, then he must have been mad. Staring at the moon can make you run mad, did you know that? And tonight the moon was round as a woman's belly swollen with child. That's when men should fear it most.<br><br>I can't ever tell the other women what I saw, not even Pega. How could I explain to them what I was doing out there alone in the forest at midnight? I'm not a lunatic, if that's what you're thinking, not like that madman. I hadn't gone into the woods trying to get myself killed, though I knew the dangers only too well. God alone knows how many deadly creatures slither and prowl through those ancient groves. Venomous adders, wild boar, savaging wolves--even a stag in rut could kill you. And if the beasts are not terrible enough, there are the cutpurses and the outlaws who prey on any stranger wandering into their domain.<br><br>Pega, though she's taller than any man alive, won't set foot in the forest after dark. None of the village women will. They say the hungry ghosts, slipping like mist between the trees, will devour you if you should chance to step upon the spot where someone once died. And over the centuries, hundreds of people must have died in these forests and left no mark.<br><br>So do you really believe I wasn't afraid to go into those woods that night? I tell you I'd had to gather up every shard of courage I had, but what else could I do? Jack-in-the-green must be gathered when the moon is fully ripe, for only then does the herb have the strength to bring back a woman's fertility. I dared not ask for any from the infirmary. We are celibate, that is the rule, and why should a celibate woman want to restore her childbearing years? But I do; I must.<br><br>The moon floated yellow and round above the treetops, pouring light down over the branches, petrifying leaf and branch to bleached bone. I trembled violently at every squeak and cry, forcing myself to keep walking deeper and deeper into the trees. I could not turn back empty-handed. Jack-in-the-green is always hard to find by sunlight or moonlight. Devil's prick, Pega calls it. The herb loves the dark, damp places among the tree roots and its spotted leaves easily conceal themselves.<br><br>I knew I must be near the river. I could hear the water thundering over the rocks. I turned away, knowing that the herb would not be growing near the water's edge, preferring the deep forest shade. Then, as if the moon herself had parted the bush with her white fingers and revealed the pale sheath, I saw it. I knelt in the damp earth, and was reaching for my knife to dig at the roots, when I heard a new sound. This was not an animal grunt. It was a man's voice.<br><br>My heart thumping, I scrambled up as silently as I could. With my back pressed against the rough tree trunk for protection and my knife grasped tightly in my hand, I peered round trying to see where the voice came from, but I could see no one. Did the hungry ghosts speak before they pounced?<br><br>Treading lightly, I tried to edge away from where I'd heard the sound. I listened, holding my breath, but no footsteps followed me. Perhaps the voice had just been in my head. I crept softly on, praying my footfall would not crack a twig and I wouldn't stumble, betraying my presence.<br><br>I had come to the edge of a clearing. A lake of quicksilver seemed to spread out at my feet. It lapped around the base of a great hollow oak tree in the centre of the glade. The oak's trunk was so massive that it would have taken half a dozen men to encircle it. The hollow inside the oak was as dark as a crypt, for even though it must have been open to the sky above, not a single ray of moonlight appeared to penetrate it.<br><br>Suddenly I heard the voice again. It was coming from somewhere in front of me. Instead of escaping from the danger, I had stumbled straight towards it.<br><br>"The blood of the white stag I pour out to Yandil, lord of the underworld. Let it be as my blood. Drink."<br><br>The voice rang out no more than a few yards from me, but the clearing was deserted. Despite the chill of the night, my hands were sticky with sweat and my heart began to pound so violently that I feared it would burst through my chest. I wanted to run, but I was too scared to move in case I was seen.<br><br>"The flesh of the white stag I lay bare for Taranis, lord of this forest. Let it be as my flesh. Eat."<br><br>I clung to the trunk of a tree and stood shaking, certain that if I let go, my legs would give way beneath me. Then I saw something moving; a black shadow was creeping across the silvered ground towards me, and it wasn't human. A long narrow snout and a pair of branched horns grew out from its chest, and four or five long tails swung from its back. It seemed to be slithering straight towards the spot where I stood. It was lengthening and reaching out towards me. I shut my eyes tightly, trying not to scream.<br><br>"The spirit of the white stag I offer up to Rantipole, lord of the air. Let it be as my spirit. Devour it."<br><br>I opened my eyes, too terrified to run. The creature stood facing the open hollow of the tree. It had its back to me. Now, as the moonlight fell full upon it, I could make sense of the nightmare I saw. It was no monster. It was a man, tall and powerfully built. Over his shoulder swung the hide of a stag with the horned head still attached. The beast was freshly slaughtered and the heat from the skin was still rising into the cold night air. I could see blood glistening wetly in the starlight. I could smell it.<br><br>"I am come to the doorway of the three realms. Give me leave to enter. Ka!"<br><br>The man pulled off his hood and tossed it aside. Then he lifted the stag's head and placed it on top of his own head. The blood dripped down over his hair and skin. Gripping the two sides of the hide, he wrapped the steaming skin around himself, like a cloak. As he raised his head, the antlers reared upwards as if he was challenging the moon.<br><br>"Hear me, Taranis, lord of destruction, a great wrong has been done to you and to us your servants. Once your creature, your creation of despair and darkness, ruled this place. This valley was named for him. Your demon brought to all who defied you death in this world and torment in the world beyond. Every man learned to fear him and in their fear they turned to you and to us, your servants. But a century ago, on the eve of Samhain, the women came to this doorway. The women could not kill your demon, but they sent him into the twilight time, the place of the shadows, where the days pass unnumbered and the years pass unmarked.<br><br>"This night I enter the doorway to seek the knowledge that will call the demon forth again. Others have dared to brave the stag's hide before me, but they perished before cockcrow, for they were not strong enough to bear your test and you destroyed them for their weakness.<br><br>"This night the hag Cailleach dies. This night Cernunnos, lord of fertility, is born. I have hunted. I have slain. I have taken his sign and his strength. As he is reborn this night, so shall I be."<br><br>The man raised his great arms, fists clenched and bellowed up at the stars.<br><br>"Taranis, lord of the night, grant me the knowledge to summon your creation, the power to call him forth, and the strength to control what is raised from the darkness! Ka!"<br><br>The man bowed his head and in one swift movement ducked into the black hollow of the bull oak.<br><br>I stared at the place where the man had disappeared, too horrified by what I'd heard to move. Silence flooded back across the clearing. The trees shivered, holding their breath. Suddenly, as panic seized me, my legs started move. They were trembling too much for me to run and I managed only to stagger a few paces when I heard a loud rustling behind me. It was as if a violent wind had sprung up and was whirling the dry leaves, except that there was no breeze. I couldn't help myself; I had to turn. I had to look back.<br><br>The clearing floor was still bathed in the ghost light, but it was no longer still and silent. Everywhere I looked, the ground was heaving. The leaf mould and newly sprouting plants were being pushed up as if a thousand moles were all trying to burrow their way to the surface at once. The mounds rose higher and higher, until suddenly they burst open, and insects began to pour out of them--beetles, worms, centipedes, engorged spiders, and great white maggots--all the creatures that feed upon the dead were crawling up from the dirt and into the moonlight.<br><br>It was impossible to see the ground, for every inch of it was writhing with the bloated insects and all of them were scuttling towards the great oak. The wings of the beetles clicked and rattled as they swarmed around the trunk towards the tree's black maw. From inside the hollow I heard the man gasp as creatures began to slither into the oak tree where he lay.<br><br>Then, as the vast tide of insects swarmed over the bark and crawled into the hollow, the man's moans gave way to a great cry of defiance and pain.<br><br>"I give my blood, Yandil, I give you my . . . blood!"<br><br>And from inside the cavernous hollow, his cry rose to shriek upon shriek of agony as if all the creatures of the grave were feeding on him, stripping his living flesh to the bare bone.<br><i>may day</i><br><br>the second of the three beltane fire days and saint walburga's day. + walburga was born in the kingdom of wessex, england, in the eighth century. + she became the abbess in charge of the double monastery of heidenheim, germany, ruling over both monks and nuns.<br><i>agatha</i><br><br>Excited barking jerked me awake.

Why are round-trip fares from Orlando to Kansas City higher than those from Kansas City to Orlando? For decades, Robert Frank has been asking his economics students to pose and answer questions like these as a way of learning how economic principles operate in the real world--which they do everywhere, all the time.Once you learn to think like an economist, all kinds of puzzling observations start to make sense. Drive-up ATM keypads have Braille dots because it's cheaper to make the same machine for both drive-up and walk-up locations. Travelers from Kansas City to Orlando pay less because they are usually price-sensitive tourists with many choices of destination, whereas travelers originating from Orlando typically choose Kansas City for specific family or business reasons.<i>The Economic Naturalist</i> employs basic economic principles to answer scores of intriguing questions from everyday life, and, along the way, introduces key ideas such as the cost benefit principle, the "no cash left on the table" principle, and the law of one price. There is no more delightful and painless way of learning these fundamental principles.</p><p><b>Robert H. Frank</b> is the Henrietta Johnson Louis Professor of Management and Professor of Economics at Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management. His Economic Scene&#x201d; column appears monthly in the <i>New York Times</i>. His previous books include <i>The Winner-Take-All Society</i> (with Philip Cook), <i>Luxury Fever</i>, and <i>Principles of Economics</i> (with Ben Bernanke). Frank's many awards include the Apple Distinguished Teaching Award and the Leontief Prize for Advancing the Frontiers of Economic Thought. He lives in Ithaca, New York.Reviewed by Steven Pearlstein<p> Long before there was Malcolm Gladwell (The Tipping Point), Steve Levitt (Freakonomics) and Tim Harford (Undercover Economist), Robert Frank had begun to critique the way his fellow economists thought about and taught "the dismal science." </p><p> In his wonderfully succinct and down-to-earth books, Frank explored the difference between absolute and relative goods, and how confusing the two got people into senseless economic "arms races." He wondered why consumers let their emotions get the better of their economic self-interest. And long before it was accepted wisdom, he explained rising income inequality in terms of the "superstars" that have begun to dominate any number of labor markets outside of sports and entertainment. </p><p> Frank, a longtime professor at Cornell University and its business school, is no slouch as an academic economist. His co-author in a widely used college textbook on microeconomics was none other than Princeton's Ben Bernanke, now chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. But at the same time, Frank has been complaining publicly for years that his profession was being hijacked by mathematical formalism that seemed determined to turn what had always been a social science, rooted in observation and experience, into a branch of the hard sciences. And there was no better proof of that, he wrote on more than a few occasions, than the dry and pre-professional way in which economics was taught to undergraduates.</p><p> In the end, however, it was not Frank but Gladwell, Levitt and Harford who finally earned fame and fortune by demonstrating how big was the appetite for an understanding of why things economic work the way they do. Perhaps hoping to ride the same wave, Frank has now written The Economic Naturalist, in which he offers answers to enigmas collected over the years by his Cornell students. </p><p> Many of the questions are quite clever. Why do drive-up ATM machines have Braille dots on the keypads? Why does it cost more to fly round-trip from Kansas City to Orlando than from Orlando to Kansas City? Why are people more likely to return cash to a store when given too much change than to return merchandise for which they were not charged? Why do fast food chains promise a free meal if the cashier doesn't offer a receipt, even though most customers don't want one? </p><p> You can imagine how such common-sense questions could form the starting points for just the kind of writing about business and economics that curious readers now crave. And sometimes, Frank's one- or two-page answers deliver on that promise. </p><p> One reason people are marrying later, for example, is that they are more mobile and more urban; consequently they don't face the problem of small-town teenagers who figure they'd better grab the best mates before they are all taken. And some waiters earn more than assistant chefs not because they contribute more value to the restaurant enterprise, but because the cooking job can be a stepping stone to more money and prestige while waiting tables leads nowhere. </p><p> I was particularly intrigued by Frank's explanation of why company managers, over time, lean toward giving more criticism than praise. According to Frank, managers who are highly critical of employees during their inevitable "slumps" kid themselves into believing that when employees' performances rise toward the average, as they usually do, it's all because of the tough love they received. On the other hand, they observe that the high-performing employees on whom they lavish so much praise inevitably wind up disappointing them as their performance reverts toward the mean. </p><p> Unfortunately, clever "enigmas" and short answers create a cumbersome and artificial organizing structure for dealing with fascinating issues such as the logic of price discrimination, the failure of collective action, and the relevance of markets to mating. The result is often repetitious and too often simplistic and unsatisfying.</p><p>We are told, for example, that sometimes goods are priced on the basis of what it costs to produce them (brown eggs) and sometimes on the basis of what people are willing to pay (sleeker, black colored Apple computers), but nowhere does Frank help us resolve this tension between demand and supply-side determination.

This book might not be appropriate for professional proofreaders in search of the definitive use of the en dash, but it is a solid, amusing volume for those who daydreamed through grade school and would like to brush up on the fundamentals. Puns, silly humor, and hyperbole abound, but so do the entertaining quotations from beloved masters of the English language that author Laurie E. Rozakis has managed to dig up. For every "The rules of standard written English are ... more frightening than a sail on the <i>Titanic</i>," there is an amusing tidbit such as this one, courtesy of Calvin Trillin: "<i>Whom</i> is a word invented to make everyone sound like a butler. Nobody who is not a butler has ever said it out loud without feeling just a little bit weird." For every "Like my thighs, the distinction between <i>that</i> and <i>which</i> is becoming less firm," we have someone such as James Thurber to show us how to break a rule in style. "When I split an infinitive," Thurber is said to have admonished a meddlesome editor, "it is going to damn well stay split!" The text is highly energetic, and Rozakis cuts to the chase. For instance, she summarizes one chapter this way: "Don't be a sexist pig; ditch doublespeak; end euphemisms; can clich�s." And she offers us these wise words, from Thomas Jefferson: "The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do."With this guide you&#39;ll gain what you need to be a great communicator at home and on the job. It provides solid information on grammatical rules and how and when to use them, friendly advice for adding variety and style to your writing, and tips, definitions, and warnings to help you along the way.</p><h2>Lone Wolf and Cub Vol. 24: In These Small Hands</h2><p>Holy hand grenades! Edo is flooded, and by flooded, we mean crazy-flooded. Bridges are crumbling, rivers are washing past retaining walls, and everything in Edo is floating away, including our vengeful ronin, his foe, and his little boy. In an ironic show of samurai respect, little Cub Daigoro gets saved by the conniving Retsudo Yagyu. And proving he can lend a hand, too, Lone Wolf Ogami pulls someone to safety as well &#x2014; but maybe he should have let him drown. Eventually, the two opposing master swordsmen dry off and go head to head in a sword fight of a thousand stances and couple of days length. This seems like it could be the deciding bout between the two, unless that nasty, Abeno Kaii gets in the way, and he seems to do that a lot lately.The true meaning of <i>Bushido,</i> the warrior code, oozes from every page of this volume. A little boy desperately attempts to drag his <i>ronin</i> father to safely, even if it costs him his own life; that same wandering samurai and his mortal enemy work together to save the frostbitten fingers of the same little boy, knowing they will eventually match swords again in a battle to the death; another samurai bites his own tongue, killing himself and locking a dark secret in his grave. The code of the samurai is complex and rich with irony, which is why so few carry this code through life. But as we draw closer to the conclusion of this epic struggle, the true bushi are stepping forth and showing their colors. It will truly be a fight to the finish. So, in these final days, a <i>ronin</i> and his young boy will visit the grave of their murdered wife and mother. It just might be the last Spring the two will share, like the many petals falling from branches.<br><br><b>This volume contains the following stories:</b><br> Child of the Fields<br> In These Samll Hands<br> Kaii Triumph<br> The Last Cherry Blossoms<br> Stone Upon Stone</p><p><b>Kazuo Koike </b>is a prolific Japanese manga writer, novelist, and entrepreneur.

Foxes and wolves had left precious little meat on the bones of the dead animal and the ravens circled each other threateningly while the sound of their harsh, disputing voices echoed across the subarctic silence of the lake.<br><br>Shambling through the dark woods along the shore, a wolverine raised his heavy head and listened. The cries of the ravens told him there was food nearby, and so he swung purposefully out on the ice in the direction of the birds.<br><br>On the north shore of the lake, where a clump of spruce trees stood thick and tall, a white husky sniffed the frigid air. He caught the musky taint of wolverine and his hackles rose. Throwing back his head he howled a challenge down the lake. At once a dozen other huskies sprang to their feet and joined in the wailing chorus.<br><br>Nestled snugly amongst the protecting trees near where the dogs were tethered stood a long, low cabin whose two windows stared owlishly out over Macnair Lake. Inside this cabin Angus Macnair put down a book he had been reading aloud and stepped to the nearest window. He watched the dogs intently for a moment or two, then, with a shake of his red, piratical beard, he turned to face three boys who were watching him expectantly.<br><br>&#x201c;Nay, lads. &#x2019;Tisna caribou they dogs is howlin&#x2019; after. Wolves maybe . . . or a wolverine. But dinna fuss yersel&#x2019;s, they caribou wull soon be comin&#x2019; back this way and then we&#x2019;ll hae fresh meat again.&#x201d;<br><br>He settled himself into a chair, picked up the book and continued with the lesson for the day.<br><br>Angus Macnair hardly looked the part of a schoolteacher. He was a massive and craggy-faced trapper who had lived in the Canadian northlands since leaving the Orkney Islands at the age of thirteen. The schoolroom was the Macnair cabin, a cluttered and low-ceilinged log structure redolent with the gamey smell from scores of pelts that hung drying from the rafters. Here Angus taught school for three days each week. During the remainder of the week teacher and students were absent from Macnair Lake, tending their traplines which ran for as much as fifty miles to the north, east, west and south.<br><br>As Angus continued reading, his nephew Jamie listened from his perch on a log beside the sheet-iron stove. Jamie&#x2019;s blue�eyed, sharp�featured face, under a mat of unkempt blond hair, was bent over a wooden stretcher balanced on his knees, as with practiced hand he scraped the flesh side of a fox skin with a blunt knife blade.<br><br>Next to him, on the edge of a log bunk, sat Awasin Meewasin, the son of the chief of the Cree Indians who lived at nearby Thanout Lake. Awasin was lean and dark, black�eyed and black-haired, and as taut and wiry as a rabbit snare.<br><br>The third &#x201c;student&#x201d; was by all odds the most striking member of the trio. His amiable, high�cheekboned face would have seemed Oriental had it not been for his wide blue eyes and the tangle of flaming red hair hanging over his forehead. This was Peetyuk. His father had been a wandering English trapper named Frank Anderson. Many years earlier Anderson had gone far out into the open Barrens to the north of Macnair Lake to spend a winter trapping white fox. Here he had met and married an Eskimo woman. Shortly before the birth of his child, Anderson had gone through the spring ice of a lake and had been drowned, leaving his son Peetyuk to be raised by the Eskimos.<br><br>The boys were particularly interested in the book Angus was reading them this day. It was a history of the early Norwegian voyages to America made long before the time of Columbus. The chapter Angus had begun that morning described how, about the year 1360, a Viking expedition sailed to Greenland and then on to North America, perhaps by way of Hudson Bay. Then it told of the finding of a strangely inscribed stone at Kensington, Minnesota, in 1898. This stone bore a message in Runic, the ancient writing of the Nordic peoples.<br><br>&#x201c;When the inscription was translated,&#x201d; Angus continued, &#x201c;it proved to be a record left by eight Swedes and twenty Norwegians on an exploring journey to the west. The runes told how the party camped one night on an island in a lake. The next day most of them went fishing, leaving ten men to guard the camp. When the fishermen returned they found their comrades dead and covered with blood. The runes also spoke of an additional ten men who had been left to guard the expedition&#x2019;s ship at a place on the sea fourteen days&#x2019; distance from the scene of the massacre. The date carved on the stone was 1362 . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Angus looked up. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s a picture of yon stane, wi&#x2019; all its markin&#x2019;s,&#x201d; he told the boys. &#x201c;Aye, Jamie and they look verra like the markin&#x2019;s on the wee bit o&#x2019; lead Jamie and Awasin found awa out on the Barrens last summer. Fetch it to me, Jamie, and we&#x2019;ll hae a look.&#x201d;<br><br>Jamie jumped to his feet and from a shelf under the rafters brought down a piece of sheet lead about six inches square. The boys clustered around Angus as the trapper laid the little lead plaque on the page opposite the drawing of the Kensington Stone.<br><br>&#x201c;Nae doot about it! The markin&#x2019;s are the same sort. I wouldna wonder if the cache where ye found yon bit of lead was made by the self�same lot what carved yon stane. Och! &#x2019;Tis too bad we canna read the writin&#x2019;, laddies.&#x201d;<br><br>Jamie&#x2019;s eyes shone with excitement. &#x201c;If the writing is the same, then the other stuff we saw at that cache must be Norse too. I&#x2019;ll bet it&#x2019;s worth a fortune!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A fortune? Aye. But if they things ye found are truly Norse they&#x2019;re worth a guid deal mair than money, lad. &#x2019;Twould maybe help to write a whole new chapter in the history of America. In any case we&#x2019;ll surely make a trip out to yon place come summertime &#x2014; though wi&#x2019; considerable more care than you two took.&#x201d;<br><br>Jamie and Awasin had the grace to look shame�faced. They were remembering only too vividly their nearly fatal journey of the previous year when they accompanied a Chipeweyan hunting party on a visit to the Barrenlands and discovered the mysterious cache. Through their own willfulness they became separated from the Indians, lost their canoe and most of their gear on a rapid, and were then forced to spend several months struggling desperately to survive the Barrenlands winter. In the end they escaped with their lives only because they were lucky enough to encounter Peetyuk and the Eskimos.*<br><br>Angus closed the book and put it carefully on a shelf with the score or so of well�worn volumes which formed his treasured library.<br><br>&#x201c;School&#x2019;s over for the week,&#x201d; he told the boys. &#x201c;Awa&#x2019; wi&#x2019; ye the noo and do yere chores while I cook up a meal.&#x201d;<br><br>When the boys had gone outside Angus stood at the window for a minute and watched them fondly. Peetyuk was busy chopping birch logs into stove lengths while Jamie and Awasin took turns wielding a long ice�chisel to open a water hole in the frozen lake. As Angus watched he pondered on the circumstances which had brought these three to his once lonely cabin.<br><br>Jamie had come to him from a southern Canadian city three years earlier when he lost both his parents in an automobile accident, leaving Angus as his only living relative. During those years Jamie had changed from a rather puny boy to a tough and competent youth who was now almost as much at home in the subarctic forests as was Awasin, who had been born there.<br><br>The farthest south Awasin had ever been was to the mission school at Pelican Narrows (a mere two hundred miles away), where he had learned to speak and read good English. But Awasin hungered after knowledge, and when Angus Macnair began schooling Jamie, Awasin easily persuaded his father, Alphonse Meewasin, to let him spend the winter months at the Macnair cabin as one of Angus&#x2019;s students.<br><br>Peetyuk came to join the little group at Macnair Lake as a result of his accidental meeting with Jamie and Awasin in the Barrenlands. The Eskimo band to which Peetyuk&#x2019;s mother belonged brought the two rescued boys south to safety. When the Eskimos returned to their own country they left Peetyuk in Angus Macnair&#x2019;s care since they believed it was time for the boy to learn something of the world of his dead father, Frank Anderson.<br>By the time the woodbox and the water pails were full Angus had lunch ready. It consisted of a savory mess of barley boiled up with dried caribou meat and a slab of fat pork. Big chunks of fresh sourdough bread and pint mugs of sweet black tea went with it.<br><br>The boys lingered long over the meal, discussing plans for a summer expedition to the Barrens to revisit the strange stone cache. They might have spent the whole of the short winter afternoon talking about the projected trip if Angus had not recalled them to reality.<br><br>&#x201c;Och, laddies! This is no way to make a catch of fur. Awa&#x2019; wi&#x2019; ye noo! And see to it ye bring hame a fine load o&#x2019; pelts. We&#x2019;ll be wantin&#x2019; the money to pay for new canoes and a&#x2019; the other gear we&#x2019;ll be needin&#x2019; for yon trip tae Eskimo Land.&#x201d;<br><br>Setting the example himself, Angus pulled on his big parka, his deerskin mittens and his heavy moccasins. When he shouldered his pack and started for the door, the boys were close behind him.<br><br>In his hurry to be the first away Jamie sprinted to his cariole (the narrow toboggan which bush trappers favor), where he dumped his pack before springing to the dog�line to unleash his huskies. He had three dogs. Two were small, rangy beasts which had belonged to his uncle. The third was a huge white husky called Fang &#x2014; one of two lost Eskimo dogs Awasin and Jamie had found out on the Barrens.<br><br>The yard now became a pandemonium of shouting boys and howling dogs. Peetyuk was the first to get his team harnessed, and with a derisive shout of farewell he jumped on the tail end of his long Eskimo sled and went careening off to the southward over the lake ice. Jamie and Awasin got away a few moments later. For a while their teams ran neck and neck, each straining to draw ahead of the other. But when Jamie began shouting &#x201c;Chaw! Chaw!&#x201d; his team obediently turned left, swinging toward the eastern side of the lake.<br><br>Angus was still methodically hitching up his dogs as the two carioles and the sled raced away from the cabin. He shook his head as he watched the wild progress of the three boys, but he was smiling.<br><br>&#x201c;Juliet, lass,&#x201d; he said as he tightened his lead dog&#x2019;s belly strap, &#x201c;they&#x2019;re a&#x2019; three of them as daft as badgers.&#x201d;<br><br>Juliet whined in reply, then thrust her shoulders against the traces, giving the signal to the other dogs to take a strain. Sedately she led the team out onto the ice and Angus&#x2019;s cariole turned away on the long northern trail.<br><br>The chill silence of a January afternoon settled down over the cabin as a last fugitive wisp of blue smoke curled upward through the old black chimney pipe.<br><i>From the eBook edition.</i></p><h2>Understanding Life: Alfred Adler</h2><p><b>An inspiring work that offers direction and wise counsel for increasing awareness of self, one's motivations, and the importance of each person's unique contribution to society.</b> <p>First published in 1926 as <i>The Science of Living,</i> Alfred Adler's <i>Understanding Life</i> provides a straightforward and common-sense system for learning more about ourselves, the reasons for our behavior, and ways to change for the better. Adler provides guidelines for discovering how our beliefs--our "private logic"--hold us back, as well as useful tools for breaking free of this negative thinking. </p><p>Stressing individual uniqueness and creative ability as well as the importance of common sense, Adler shows us how to work toward our goals without worrying about the outcome. "Self-worth depends not on ultimate success," he writes, "but on doing one's best. What's important is not the abilities and advantages we have, but what we do with what we are given." </p><p>Acknowledging that service to others is a key component in individual healing and growth, Adler further emphasizes our responsibility to contribute to the common good. <i>Understanding Life</i> offers both an ideal vision for humankind's future and the guidelines for personal growth and social responsibility that will help us contribute to that future's realization. "We are all goal-directed," he writes, "attracted by a future which we ourselves create." </p><p><b>About the author:</b> A contemporary of Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler was born in a Vienna suburb to a Jewish grain merchant. After becoming a medical doctor, Adler went on to found individual psychology and write more than 300 books and papers on child psychology, marriage, education, and the principles of individual psychology. Adler died in 1937 and is recognized along with Freud and Jung as one of the three great fathers of modern psychotherapy. </p><p><b>About the editor:</b> Colin Brett is an accredited Adlerian counselor and former Training Officer of the Adlerian Society of Great Britain.

It looks like a straight-forward sex crime, but when Superintendent Lannes is warned off the investigation, his suspicion that there is a political motive for the murder seems justified. In defiance of authority, he continues working on the case. And then another body is found...Meanwhile, the Superintendent has other troubles. His eldest son, Dominique, is at the Front, his wife, Marguerite, is depressed, and when the Battle of France breaks out, Bordeaux is filled with refugees fleeing the war. Suddenly civilian crime seems of little importance compared to the chaos that ensues. As Bordeaux becomes an occupied city, Lannes&#39; chief suspect is untouchable, protected by a relative in the Vichy government. Lannes himself is threatened with blackmail on account of his Jewish friends and Dominique is taken prisoner. Common sense should make Lannes abandon the investigation, but honour and a natural obstinacy lead him to pursue it. However, as events turn increasingly bleak, Lannes begins to doubt it can ever be solved...</p><p>Allan Massie is the author of twenty novels including the critically acclaimed World War II trilogy: A Question of Loyalties, The Sins of the Father, and Shadows of Empire.

Other novels include Harvest Home, Crowned Heads, and The Night of the Moonbow. He died in 1991. The Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Ramsey Campbell as &#34;Britain&#39;s most respected living horror writer&#34;. He has been given more awards than any other writer in the field, including the Grand Master Award of the World Horror Convention and the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Horror Writers Association.&#x201c;It is perhaps unfair and a little inaccurate to typecast <i>The Other </i>as a horror story. It is so ingenious and well-written that it transcends that&#x2014;or any&#x2014;label. The setting is the small Connecticut town of Pequot Landing, which under other circumstances, might be idyllic.&nbsp; But the people who inhabit Tryon&#x2019;s New England are just as haunted as O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s, and a lot more violent...His [Tryon&#x2019;s] characterizations have depth and subtlety, the narrative is well-paced and suspenseful.

The 1971 horror classic is a tale of a seemingly bucolic farmhouse in a small Connecticut town in the 1930s. There are no vampires in the story, no ghosts, no swamp monsters or ghouls or zombies or witches. There are two little boys, twins Niles and Holland, the picture of innocence. Or so it seems. The story is told in the voice of one of the boys, now older and a resident of a sanitarium. Insanity, it seems, is a family inheritance, and insanity is at the core of the chilling story that slowly unfolds and culminates in some horrifying deaths.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Advocate </i>(Baton Rouge)<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Truly extraordinary!

Now, drawing on hundreds of interviews and previously untapped sources, James Gavin gives a hair-raising account of the trumpeter&#x2019;s dark journey.<br><br>The story of Baker&#x2019;s demise&#x2014;a heretofore unsolved riddle&#x2014;is revealed here at last. So is the truth behind his tormented childhood, the pain of which haunted his entire life. Gavin explores the birth of the melancholy trumpet playing, the fragile tenor voice, and the otherworldly personal aura that catapulted Baker to fame. Sexy, angelic, needy, and forbidding all at once, Baker became known as the James Dean of jazz. Like Dean, he struck a note of menace in the staid fifties: behind his ultracool, handsome fa�ade lay something ominous, unspoken. The mystery drove both sexes crazy. But his only real romance, apart from music, was with drugs. And in mesmerizing detail, Gavin narrates the harrowing spiral of dependency down which Baker tumbled, dragging with him those who dared get close.<br><br>From his golden promise to his eventual destruction, Baker&#x2019;s life mirrored America&#x2019;s fall from postwar innocence. <i>Deep in a Dream</i> is the portrait of a musician whose singular artistry and mystique have never lost their power to enchant and seduce us.</p><p>James Gavin is the author of <i>Intimate Nights: The Golden Age of New York Cabaret,</i> a winner of ASCAP&#x2019;s Deems Taylor Award.

He lives in New York City.1<br><br>The Christmas season of 1929 arrived just weeks after the stock market had crashed. But that December, nineteen-year-old Vera Baker got the gift of her dreams. In her little Oklahoma house, she gazed down at the infant in her arms, an angel with alabaster skin and hazel eyes. When he smiled at her, she saw magic. The child would surely lift her above the cold realities of marriage to a frequently unemployed alcoholic; more than that, he would bring meaning to her life, supplying all the tenderness and excitement that were missing. He was named Chesney, after his father. But with his chubby cheeks and dark hair, the child seemed like a tiny replica of herself. From the time of his birth, "Chettie,"as she called him, was the center of Vera's universe.<br><br>Her obsession with him, and his father's response to it, had a darker effect on Chet Baker than he ever acknowledged; even he probably didn't understand it. Years later, he told Lisa Galt Bond, his collaborator on an unfinished memoir, "I had a very happy childhood; no problems."The tendency to keep things hidden had been ingrained in him from an early age. In 1954 he brought his French girlfriend, Liliane Cukier, to his parents' home during the first national tour of the Chet Baker Quartet. She observed the Bakers for three weeks. "This was a family where nobody hollered, didn't say what they had in their hearts or in their minds,"she noticed. "Everyone was just trying to be cool."<br><br>Cukier recalled Chesney and Vera as "Oklahoma peasants, ordinary white people from way in the center."Starting in 1946, Chesney drove a yellow cab, the only job he had held on to for more than a couple of years. For a while in the twenties, he had lived his dream by touring as a guitar and banjo player. He worked mainly in hillbilly bands, but according to his son, Chesney had a feeling for jazz: he could whistle the licks of his hero, the Texas-born trombone master Jack Teagarden, while improvising on guitar.<br><br>Then came the Depression and the birth of his child, and he was forced to quit music and take a series of dreary survival jobs. He rarely mentioned his frustration, but it showed on his face: by his thirties he looked old and haggard, with crow's-feet spreading down his cheeks, pointing to a mouth that rarely smiled. He kept his sandy hair combed back, exposing a deeply furrowed brow. That prematurely ravaged look was inherited by his son, whose facial decay in later years would be commonly blamed on drug abuse. Chesney, though, aged far less strikingly. Bernie Fleischer recalled him as "very bland-looking,"a man who faded into the background: "He was one of those shadowy figures who was always away somewhere."In the forties, Chesney surfaced occasionally to brag to his son's musician friends about a night when the great Teagarden had come to the house to jam with him. Some of them would later suspect that the fabled meeting had never happened at all.<br><br>Liquor helped Chesney dull the truth, including memories of a grim childhood. His family had moved from Illinois, where he was born on January 24, 1906, to Snyder, Oklahoma. Life in Snyder seemed cursed&#x2013;not just by the tornado and fires that had plagued the small town, but by domestic strife. Vera later explained that Chesney's father, George Baker, had deserted his mother, Alice, and their five children for another woman. Alice went on to marry "Grandpa Beardsley,"as the family knew him, a farmer with a bad leg and a nasty temper. Grandpa Beardsley seemed to hate his stepson on sight; Chesney told Vera that the older man beat him with his cane and badgered him to leave the house and never come back. Alice tried to protect her son, but Chesney fled before he was eighteen. For the rest of his life he hated his father and stepfather. Even after the latter had suffered a stroke and needed two canes to walk, Chesney had no sympathy; he grumbled to Vera that he wouldn't cross the street to see his stepfather even if the old man were on his deathbed.<br><br>It was in his teens that Chesney first found solace in the infant art of jazz. An improvisational music born of gospel, Negro spirituals, blues, and ragtime, jazz was all about letting the imagination take wing, molding split-second flights of fancy into personal statements of the heart. Chesney needed escape, and jazz seemed like the perfect vehicle. Besides Teagarden, whose ability to play trombone with endless invention defined the form, one other star fascinated Chesney: Bix Beiderbecke, a cornetist with a rich tone, a spareless, and a poignance seldom found in early jazz, which tended to sound like party music.<br><br>Chesney taught himself to play banjo, a popular instrument in traditional, or "Dixieland,"jazz, and thus wrote his own ticket out of Snyder. The still-tiny jazz circuit seemed out of his reach, so he joined a series of country-western bands that entertained at dances throughout Oklahoma and other Midwestern states. It was a hand-to-mouth existence, but never had he known such joy: he lived each day for music, then unwound at night by drinking and smoking reefer, just like his heroes.<br><br>In 1928, Chesney passed through Yale, Oklahoma, a small oil town between Tulsa and Oklahoma City. Yale was so marginal that, in years to come, many state history books failed to mention it. The city's only claim to fame was Jim Thorpe, the American Indian whose 1912 Olympic triumphs in football and track had won him the title "World's Greatest Athlete"and inspired a Hollywood movie, <i>Jim Thorpe: All American</i>, starring Burt Lancaster. During the twenties, most of Yale's 2,600 other residents worked in the town's oil fields and refineries or as farmers.<br><br>One of the latter was Salomon Wesley Moser, a native of Iowa. In 1889, he had joined the legendary Oklahoma Run, in which white settlers charged in on horseback to drive Indians off the fertile land and claim it for themselves. Moser took eighty acres and started a farm. Around that time he met and married Randi, a young blind woman from Norway. The couple had seven children, who tended the farm. The next-to-youngest, Vera Pauline, was born there in May 1910. Vera grew into an unglamorous teenager. Short and stocky, she wore her mousy brown hair hanging down and parted in the middle. Her deep-set eyes were surrounded by little lines, deepened through years of exposure to the Oklahoma sun and dry winds.<br><br>At eighteen, Vera went to a Saturday-night barn dance where the young men and women of Yale gathered to find mates. She and the visiting guitar player, Chesney Baker, caught each other's eye. "He was such a handsome fellow!"Vera recalled. After a brief courtship they were wed by a justice of the peace, and found a cozy house at 326 South B Street in Yale. But any dreams Vera may have had for married bliss crumbled when Chesney skipped the honeymoon to go on tour, leaving her in Yale. Rather than live alone, she went back to her parents' farm, where she waited almost a year for her husband to return.<br><br>Their estrangement ended abruptly in October 1929, when the stock market crash wiped out people's entertainment budgets, along with Chesney's modest career. Just before Christmas, he came home broke and bereft of prospects to find his wife seven months pregnant, which only compounded his worries. On Monday, December 23, Vera gave birth to Chesney Henry Baker, Jr. Suddenly the disappointments of her marriage didn't seem to matter. Vera refashioned her life around Chettie. She bought a Brownie box camera and began obsessively photographing her beautiful son&#x2013;one way she could possess his every move. She documented his infancy in a photo album called <i>The Dear Baby</i>. Under the heading "Baby's Most Cherished Playthings,"she noted the odd combination of a doll and a Tinkertoy car, a portent of the sexual ambiguity for which he eventually became known. When Chettie murmured "I ov u,"she wrote it neatly under "Some of Baby's First Sayings."<br><br>Vera's infatuation with her newborn son couldn't erase her fear of a bleak future. She fretted over how they would survive with no income. When Chesney finally found work, it was bitterly removed from the guitar strumming he loved: he smashed up old boilers with a sledgehammer in an oil field for twenty-five cents an hour. But even that job vanished as the Yale refineries fell victim one by one to the Depression. Life there seemed hopeless, and when Chettie was about a year old, his parents took him and headed for Oklahoma City, the state capital. Purely by chance, the town had escaped the worst effects of the crash: just months before, an oil well had been drilled there, setting off a thriving petroleum industry. Several public-works projects were launched, and out of them came the Oklahoma Arts Center and the Oklahoma City Symphony. All this cultural activity made Chesney think he might be able to play again.<br><br>He and Vera rented a small house downtown, on a street lined with shops and factories. Compared with Yale, Oklahoma City felt like a big-time metropolis. Pedestrians stared up in awe at the state's first "skyscraper,"twelve stories high; they streamed in and out of the First National Bank building, the Biltmore Hotel, the YWCA, and other modern structures. Steam trains puffed white clouds as they chugged along the Rock Island and Frisco railroad lines, which ran through the center of town. The city's sparkle filled the Bakers with hope. Vera found a job in an ice-cream factory, while Chesney joined a band at radio station WKY, opening the broadcast day at 6 a.m. with a half-hour of hillbilly music. Fiddle players, a drummer, and guitarist Chesney huddled around a stand-up microphone in blue jeans and vests, stomping out a backbeat with their cowboy boots as they played. Often Chesney brought his son, then looked after him at home until Vera returned, bearing quarts of ice cream. On weekends, the band gathered at the house and jammed all night. For Chesney, life was complete again.<br><br>According to...</p><h2>Against Creativity</h2><p><b>Everything you have been told about creativity is wrong.</b><br><br>From line managers, corporate CEOs, urban designers, teachers, politicians, mayors, advertisers and even our friends and family, the message is 'be creative'. Creativity is heralded as the driving force of our contemporary society; celebrated as agile, progressive and liberating. It is the spring of the knowledge economy and shapes the cities we inhabit. It even defines our politics. What could possibly be wrong with this?<br><br>In this brilliant, counter intuitive blast Oli Mould demands that we rethink the story we are being sold. Behind the novelty, he shows that creativity is a barely hidden form of neoliberal appropriation. It is a regime that prioritizes individual success over collective flourishing. It refuses to recognise anything - job, place, person - that is not profitable. And it impacts on everything around us: the places where we work, the way we are managed, how we spend our leisure time. <br><br>Is there an alternative? Mould offers a radical redefinition of creativity, one embedded in the idea of collective flourishing, outside the tyranny of profit.

It needs to be taken seriously&#x2014;but it also, arguably, needs to be taken down.

He is the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship, a fellowship in fiction from the New York Foundation for the Arts and a Lannan Literary Fellowship, and was named a &#x201c;20 under 40&#x201d; writer to watch by <i>The New Yorker. </i>Mengestu&#x2019;s writing has appeared in <i>The New Yorker, Rolling Stone, Harper&#x2019;s, Granta</i>, and other publications. He lives with his family in Washington, D.C.Ethiopian escapes genocide, makes new life in Washington <p>For anyone who's caught the gaze of a foreign-born waiter or cabdriver and wished for a deeper understanding of his half-glimpsed life, reading fiction is one way to crack open the dusty window that often separates us. It's all the more intriguing when the writer is as observant as 29-year-old Dinaw Mengestu, who immigrated to America in 1980, after his family fled Ethiopia's genocidal Red Terror. His haunting and powerful first novel, "The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears," is one of the first to give voice to that experience. </p><p>His story centers on 36-year-old Sepha Stephanos, who left his mother and brother in Ethiopia 17 years earlier, after his father was brutalized and escorted to his death by soldiers backing Mengistu Haile Mariam, the Communist dictator who overthrew the senile Haile Selassie. </p><p>For the past decade, Stephanos has been quietly reading Dostoyevsky, Dante and Naipaul behind the counter of his convenience store in a run-down Washington, D.C., neighborhood. His evenings are punctuated by visits from Kenneth from Kenya and Joe from Congo that glitter with dark wit. The three, who met years before, when they were valets at a local hotel, now drink shots beneath a 20-year-old map of Africa and play a game that begins when one of them names a dictator; the challenge to the others is to guess the year and country of each coup. </p><p>Into this world of suppressed dreams and frustrated memories walks Naomi, an angular 11-year-old know-it-all who, like Stephanos, misses her African father. She starts visiting Stephanos regularly and reads the newspaper with him, stealing his heart as she gravely shakes her head over the failure of American policy in the Middle East and the lack of resources devoted to the global AIDS crisis. </p><p>The spark between this spirited girl and cautious man shines through in their dialogue, which is among the sharpest in the book. It also draws Stephanos closer to Naomi's mother, Judith, a single, white professor who stands out because she's renovating one of the grand old houses in this predominantly black neighborhood, and also because her daughter's skin is "lighter than black but darker than white." Soon, Judith and Stephanos begin a hesitant romance, pushing him to consider for the first time what it might feel like to be part of a family again. (The book's title comes from "The Inferno," when Dante emerges from hell and once again lays his eyes on the stars.) </p><p>But the same wave of gentrification that brought Judith and Naomi into Stephanos' neighborhood ushers in economic and social pressures threatening his livelihood. Judith's shining four-story mansion also becomes a powerful symbol of the tipping social scale, as longtime black residents are evicted from the area. </p><p>We know from the outset that Stephanos' relationship with Judith is doomed, and his resulting downward spiral doesn't always propel the reader along at a fast clip. But what keep the pages turning are Mengestu's tangy and perceptive characterizations and well-crafted set pieces that are alive with personal experience. </p><p>Mengestu wrings bravado and pathos out of an episode where Kenneth puts on a suit and rents a car, to make the right impression when he and Stephanos try to buy a used car. After pulling into the dealership "cautiously, as if every minor gesture of ours were being judged," Kenneth decides against going into the main office, instead donning sunglasses and waiting for a salesman to come to him, as he and Stephanos lean coolly against the hood of his car. But the two African immigrants never get more than a "one-eyed glance" from the salesmen and leave 20 minutes later, empty-handed. </p><p>Among the most arresting scenes are those involving Stephanos' uncle Berhane Selassie, who is 20 years older than he and once lived on a well-appointed ranch outside Addis Ababa. At least among those in his close-knit apartment building, Selassie has retained the aura of respect that his name commanded in the old regime. Though now working as a cabdriver during the day and parking attendant at night, Selassie sometimes reveals "remnants of the humorous, snobbish young man he had once been." For example, when he comes home grinning inexplicably after his long day's work and Stephanos asks him why, Selassie responds enthusiastically, "Gas is so cheap!," though clearly that's the last reason he came to this country. </p><p>When Stephanos gets his own eviction notice and his confidence in his business falters, he returns to the apartment he used to share with his uncle and opens a lockbox in Selassie's closet. Inside are the letters his uncle wrote to U.S. Presidents Carter and Reagan during the Red Terror. </p><p>The first letter to Carter -- before his uncle shed his innocence and began writing in the spare, detailed style he found in the Washington Post -- still tugs at Stephanos: "Dear President Carter ... I am one of those people for whom nothing is left of their home country. Everything I have has been taken away from me. For many ages, the United States and Ethiopia have been close allies. There is a deep friendship between our two countries. Therefore, it is imperative that the United States, along with Ethiopia's friends in Europe, come to her aid at this critical juncture in her history." That "friendship" between the United States and Ethiopia, which was solidified when Ethiopia became a founding member of the League of Nations and later the United Nations, has long since been betrayed by the Cold War and oil politics abroad. Yet, as Mengestu closely observes the human face of that betrayal, as it plays out amid the racism and class politics of Washington, D.C., he gives us another chance to understand the Ethiopian American experience, in a deeply felt novel that deserves to be read. -- <i><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, March 11, 2007</i><br><br>Mengestu has told a rich and lyrical story of displacement and loneliness. I was profoundly moved by this tale of Ethiopian immigrant's search for acceptance, peace, and identity. -- <i>Khaled Hosseini, author of <i>The Kite Runner</i> and <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i></i><br><br>These characters are artfully crafted, original and complex in their humanity. Mengestu wants us to know them, to hear their story, and he succeeds in giving us a novel that is fresh and new. -- <i><i>Miami Herald</i></i><br><br>This a great African novel, a great Washington novel, and a great American novel. -- <i><i>The New York Times Book Review</i></i><br><br>This first novel, by an Ethiopian-American, sings of the immigrant experience, an old American story that people renew every generation, but it sings in an existential key...His straightforward language and his low-key voice combine to make a compelling narrative, one that loops back in time yet seems to move forward with an even pace. -- <i>Alan Cheuse, <i>Dallas Morning News</i></i><br><br>This is not a story for only an immigrant audience.

In life, people don't usually kill each other. They talk").<br><br>Through the plays of these masters, Adler discusses the arts of playwriting and script interpretation ("There are two aspects of the theater. One belongs to the author and the other to the actor. The actor thinks it all belongs to the author. . .The curtain goes up and all he knows are the lines. . .It is not enough. . .Script interpretation is your profession").<br><br>She looks into aspects of society and class, and into our cultural past, as well as the evolution of the <br>modern spirit ("The actor learns from Ibsen what is modern in the modern theater. There are no villains, no heroes. Ibsen understands, more than anything, there is more than one truth").<br><br>Stella Adler--daughter of Jacob Adler, who was universally acknowledged to be the greatest actor <br>of the Yiddish theater, and herself a disciple of Stanislavsky--examines the role of the actor and brings to life the plays from which all modern theater derives: Ibsen's <i>Hedda Gabler, The Master Builder, An Enemy of the People,</i> and <i>A Doll's House;</i> Strindberg's <i>Miss Julie</i> and <i>The Father;</i> Chekhov's <i>The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, The Cherry Orchard,</i> and Three Sisters ("Masha is the sister who is the mystery. You cannot reach her. You cannot reach the artist. There is no logical way. Keep her in a special pocket of feelings that are complex and different"). <br><br>Adler discusses the ideas behind these plays and explores the world of the playwrights and the <br>history--both familial and cultural--that informed their work. She illumines not only the dramatic essence of each play but its subtext as well, continually asking questions that deepen one's understanding of the work and of the human spirit. <br><br>Adler's book, brilliantly edited by Barry Paris, puts her famous lectures into print for the first time.</p><p>"The book is superb. Stella's words burn off the page like her beauty, her scornful glance, her authority, and the fire in her truth."<br>-- Irene Worth<p>"A beautiful treasure for actors and directors. Brilliant and passionate."<br>-- Kim Stanley</p><p>"These inspired lectures are evidence that Stella Adler is hands down the greatest acting teacher America has produced. And they're not just for actors -- she illuminates Chekhov, Ibsen and Strindberg in a way that will challenge you, stimulate you and make you see. Nobody with a serious interest in the theater can afford to be without this book."<br>-- John Guare</p><p>"Stella Adler taught actors to invite into their performances the culture expressed by a role and a play rather than to become technicians. Her book should deepen actors' perceptions of their art and help them to make real for themselves theatre's humanistic heart."<br>-- Arthur Miller</p><p>"Stella's glorious conceit aside, throw out all of the other books on Ibsen, Strindberg, and Chekhov and maybe those on acting as well, because now we have Stella's."<br>-- Zoe Caldwell</p><p>"Jacob Adler said that unless you give the audience something bigger -- better --do not act. Here is a book that will do that for its reader. To see Ibsen, Strindberg, and Chekhov through an actor whose eyes have been opened by Stella Adler is as if to see, hear and feel their genius for the first time. And to hear her teach is to hear teaching, not just acting, being taught. For those who like to keep in shape, there are exercises as well. You'll sweat, but that's the idea."<br>-- William H. Gass</p><p></p>An original member of the famed Group Theater, Stella Adler was one of the most influential artists to come out of the American theater. As a Stanislavsky disciple and founder of her own highly esteemed acting conservatory, the extravagant actress was also an eminent acting teacher, training her students -- among them Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and Robert DeNiro -- in the art of script interpretation.<p>The classic lectures collected here, delivered over a period of forty years, bring to life the plays of the three fathers of modern drama: Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, and Anton Chekhov. With passionate conviction and shrewd insight, Adler explains how their plays forever changed the world of dramaturgy while offering enduring insights on society, class, culture, and the role of the actor. She explores the struggles of Ibsen's characters to free themselves from societal convention, the mortal conflicts that trap Strindberg's men and women, and the pain of loss and transition lyrically evoked by Chekhov. A majestic volume, Stella Adler on Ibsen, Strindberg, and Chekhov allows us to experience the work of these masters "as if to see, hear and feel their genius for the first time". (William H.

In addition, as we follow Duffy through his gentle adventures, a clock is cleverly tucked into each illustration, showing children the time of day-and helping them learn how to tell time!Like most pugs, Duffy loves to sleep, and from the time he wakes for breakfast to the time he prepares for bed, Duffy&#39;s day is punctuated by delicious naps: the Before Breakfast Nap; the After Breakfast Nap; the Late Morning Nap; and so on. When his best friend, a playful girl, comes home from school, Duffy helps her with her homework, follwed by his Early Evening Nap.With their typical wry humor, the Woods end their story with Duffy and his friend wearing matching pajamas in bed, reading a book.

He and his wife, Audrey, live in an off-grid, untamed area of Hawaii with their three dogs, two goats, and a flock of chickens.The Woods, who have collaborated on such celebrated children&#x2019;s books as The Napping House (1984), have another collaboration going, that of keeping their two pug dogs thriving. This book is about one of their pugs, Duffy. It&#x2019;s also about telling time: the illustrations have cleverly hidden clocks that show the times that nap-loving Duffy succumbs to his Before Breakfast, After Breakfast, Early Afternoon, and Early Evening naps. The Woods have a sure-handed knack for showing the daily life of a dog (whose biggest excitements come from the appearance of food, other dogs, and, of course, all those naps) in a way that is not only funny but will connect with kids establishing their own routines. The watercolors mark time as well, moving from the golden warmth of the day to the cooler shadings of dusk, and finally into the soft gold of a home&#x2019;s interior at night.

Preschool-Grade 1. --Connie Fletcher</p><h2>With the Jocks: A Soldier&#39;s Struggle for Europe 1944-45</h2><p>Born in battle, Peter White's journal is one of the most extraordinary stories to come out of the Second World War. As a 24-year-old lieutenant in the King's Own Scottish Borderers, Peter kept an unauthorised journal of his regiment's advance through the Low Countries and into Germany in the closing months of the war in Europe. <p>Forbidden by his commanding officer from doing so for security reasons, Peter's boyhood habit of diary-keeping had become an obsession too strong to shake off. Each day he found time to record in copious detail the war going on around him, the lives and deaths of the men with whom he served, and the inexorable Allied advance into the Third Reich.</p><p>In one of the most graphic and finely crafted evocations of a soldier at war, the images he records are not for the faint-hearted. There are heroes aplenty within its pages, but there are also disturbing insights into the darker side of humanity, frequently brushed aside in many other war accounts - the men who broke under the strain and who ran away (sometimes with tragic results); the binge drinking that occasionally rendered the whole platoon unable to fight; the looting and the callous disregard for human life that happens when death is a daily companion.</p><p>Hidden away for more than fifty years, White's diary is a remarkable account of the horrors of war experienced by a British soldier in the greatest conflict of the twentieth century. </p></p><p></p><h2>The Swiss Family Robinson (Illustrated Junior Library)</h2><p>The enchanting story of a shipwrecked family--a minister, his wife, and four sons, Fritz, Ernest Francis, and Jack--who are cast up on a desert island, build a wonderful house in a tree, and survive so cleverly and happily apart from the world that they never want to be rescued.</p><p>Johann David Wyss (1743-1818) was, like the narrator of his famous story, a Swiss pastor who had four sons. He is best remembered for Swiss Family Robinson which it is said was inspired by Daniel Defoe&#39;s Robinson Crusoe and which became an international classic bestseller.</p><h2>Beyond the Pleasure Principle (Broadview Editions)</h2><p><p> <em>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</em> is Freud&#x2019;s most philosophical and speculative work, exploring profound questions of life and death, pleasure and pain. In it Freud introduces the fundamental concepts of the &#x201c;repetition compulsion&#x201d; and the &#x201c;death drive,&#x201d; according to which a perverse, repetitive, self-destructive impulse opposes and even trumps the creative drive, or Eros. The work is one of Freud&#x2019;s most intensely debated, and raises important questions that have been discussed by philosophers and psychoanalysts since its first publication in 1920. </p> <p> The text is presented here in a contemporary new translation by Gregory C. Richter. Appendices trace the work&#x2019;s antecedents and the many responses to it, including texts by Plato, Friedrich Nietzsche, Melanie Klein, Herbert Marcuse, Jacques Derrida, and Judith Butler, among many others. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Todd Dufresne</strong> is Professor of Philosophy and founding Director of the Advanced Institute for Globalization &amp; Culture at Lakehead University. He is the author of five books, including <em>Tales From the Freudian Crypt: The Death Drive in Text and Context</em> (Stanford University Press) and <em>Killing Freud</em> (Continuum). </p> <p> <strong>Gregory C. Richter</strong> is Professor of German and Linguistics at Truman State University. His translations include <em>The Incest Theme in Literature and Legend</em> by Otto Rank and <em>Inside Psychoanalysis: The Letters of Sigmund Freud and Otto Rank</em> (both The Johns Hopkins University Press). </p><p> &#x201c;The collection of writings gathered here cover a great breadth and demonstrate quite clearly the importance of the ideas proposed in Freud&#x2019;s <em>Beyond</em>.&#x201d; &#x2015; <em>Metapsychology</em> </p> <p> &#x201c;Todd Dufresne&#x2019;s book sets a new standard for critical editions of Freud. In addition to the lucid new English translation by Gregory C. Richter, there is a splendidly informative introduction, related excerpts from Freud&#x2019;s other works, and a provocative appendix of critical essays, including contributions from Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Marcuse, Derrida, and Zizek, that challenge and destabilize this &#x2018;metaphysical&#x2019; essay of Freud&#x2019;s middle period. The pleasures of the text are rich and complex; in it we see Freud, as Dufresne aptly notes, moving &#x2018;beyond psychoanalysis, in philosophy&#x2019;&#x2015;a journey of joyful intellectual homecoming.&#x201d; &#x2015; Mark Kingwell, Professor of Philosophy, University of Toronto </p> <p> &#x201c;Freud&#x2019;s strange and conceptually adventurous <em>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</em> carves out a wholly original space between philosophy, psychology, and biology&#x2015;a space we still find difficult to occupy, but one that opens up a range of challenging theoretical ideas from which we can continue to learn. In this new edition, Todd Dufresne expertly re-introduces us to a book that has spawned many important philosophical responses and interventions over the past half-century and reminds us why it is such a key book in Freud&#x2019;s oeuvre. Gregory C. Richter&#x2019;s superb new translation and Dufresne&#x2019;s fantastic choice of both older theories on which Freud draws and newer thinkers who draw on Freud make this a book that anyone interested in contemporary philosophy and critical theory should add to their libraries and their classrooms.&#x201d; &#x2015; Imre Szeman, Canada Research Chair in Cultural Studies, University of Alberta </p></p><h2>The Mechanical Devil (Wesley Peterson)</h2><p><p><b>'One of the finest murder mystery series out there'</b></p><p>When archaeologist Neil Watson unearths a long-buried mechanical figure in a Dartmoor field, he is determined to discover the truth behind the bizarre find.</p><p>Soon, however, the sleepy village becomes the focus of press attention for another reason when two people with no apparent connection to each other are found shot dead in nearby Manor Field, seemingly victims of an execution-style double murder.</p><p>DI Wesley Peterson is called in to investigate, but the two murders aren't his only problem.

It is difficult to explain to someone who has never seen it. You can fold his town into a corner of one of the city's five separate sectors and still have room for more. The next thing you need to know is that it's dangerous. Never mind the reassuring bulletins from the mayor's office; just watch the first ten minutes of the eleven o'clock news and you'll learn exactly what the people of this city are capable of doing to other people in this city. So, if you came here thinking, Gee, there's going to be a neat little murder that takes place in a town house and some blue-haired lady will solve it, then you came to the wrong city at the wrong time of year. In this city, you have to pay attention. In this city, things are happening all the time, all over the place, and you don't have to be a detective to smell evil in the wind. <br> This week's city tabloids depict the face of a pretty, dead girl who lay sprawled near a park bench not seven blocks from the 87th precinct house, while the late night news reports on the latest exploits of The Cookie Boy, a professional thief who leaves a box of chocolate chip cookies behind after a score. Behind the scenes, detectives Carella and Brown soon discover that this is not your average dead girl, but one with an unusual past. As they piece together her secrets, detectives Meyer and Kling search Isola's pawnshops for items stolen by The Cookie Boy. While the detectives are investigating their cases, one of them is being stalked by the man who killed his father. <br> Like the city itself, this novel is wonderfully complex and filled with memorable characters, honest dialogue, and breathtaking violence.</p><p>Ed McBain is the only American winner of the coveted Diamond Dagger Award, and he is also a past recipient of the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award. So, when a reader picks up the latest installment of McBain's 87th Precinct series, the bar is set pretty high. But with <i>The Big Bad City</i>, McBain meets expectations. <p> In the opening pages, Steve Carella and Artie Brown return to the department with 9 basketball players (the 10th player was murdered) only to discover a knife fight erupting in a holding cell. It's a steamy August night, and Carella and Detective Parker end up having to shoot one of the fighters to cool things down. Then Meyer and Kling enter the scene; they're hot in pursuit of the Cookie Boy, a thief who leaves chocolate-chip cookies at every crime sight. Before the interminable day is done, Carella and Brown are called out to Grover Park to investigate a homicide. A nun has been strangled to death, but she's no ordinary Sister. She's got signs of a breast augmentation operation that hint at a sordid past. Finally, readers are privy to a conversation between Juju and Sonny. Sonny killed a cop's dad, and Juju is convinced that the police will bend the rules to see that Sonny winds up dead. Juju insists that the only way out of the death trap is to kill the cop first. The officer's name is Steve Carella. And all of this happens in the first 15 pages.</p><p> McBain is one of the artists of the police procedural. Though his city is fictional, it breathes with the darkness and gritty reality of many American cities. He enters the minds and hearts of his characters to uncover the daily insecurities that accompany the work of policemen. Readers new to the 87th Precinct will want to venture back to such tales as 1956's <i>Cop Hater</i>, 1964's <i>Ax</i>, and 1965's <i>Doll</i>, among the 47 installments in this series. Those who've been along for the ride will be happy they did not give up their seat. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Ed McBain, a recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's coveted Grand Master Award, was also the first American to receive the Diamond Dagger, the British Crime Writers Association's highest award.

And now the Thief is caught in a tangle even he might not be able to escape.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, March 2012</strong>: In Fuminori Nakamura's new novel, the main character weaves along the streets of Tokyo pickpocketing his way through the flow of humanity, as if in a dream. He lifts wallets filled with cash and credit cards with a masterful ease, his mind occupied with a trance-like debate about whether to care anymore. Whether to care about the young kid he sees clumsily stealing food at a supermarket. Whether to care about his partner, who disappeared after a botched robbery years ago. Oscillating between the real connection he establishes with the shoplifting boy and the drug-like daze of his own criminal past, the thief drifts back into the clutches of the mastermind of that ill-fated robbery. And the thief starts to wake up, only to realize that a noose is being carefully, and slowly, drawn around his neck. <i>--Benjamin Moebius</i>Fuminori Nakamura was born in 1977 and graduated from Fukushima University in 2000.

Glad to be back in his old Queens (N.Y.) neighborhood, happy to help out his sister-in-law and four young nieces, likable Mike is surprised to learn that the main draw at the Smoking Car is its bevy of topless dancers. Settling into his work, he worries first that the bar's staff and clientele--whose personalities quickly supercede their stereotypes--will discover he's a priest and then that his corn-fed Nebraska fiancee will discover his new line of work. Mostly, however, he struggles gamely to resolve the conflict between his spiritual inclinations and those of the flesh. The weeks pass and his brother fails to show up; Mike suspects drugs are being traded in the establishment; four of the dancers are gruesomely killed. A dramatic climax, while somewhat contrived, leads to a satisfying denouement in this reflective, appreciative novel from Mano ( The Bridge ), who is definitely not a leg man. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Lively debut of a mystery series by the author of Take Five (1982), etc. Once known for his off-putting and dense verbal energy, Mano has slimmed down to a racing-car sentence that still packs high- powered inventiveness. Tony Wilson, the brother of Father Mike Wilson, an Episcopal priest in Nebraska, has disappeared in Queens. Will Mike come east and run Tony's topless bar for his wife Ethel and their four daughters until Tony resurfaces? Mike leaves his librarian fianc&#x201a;e Kay behind, finds himself hiring and firing topless dancers at the Smoking Car (Mano handles all this flesh marvelously, does a knockout documentary on topless dancers as professionals), and ends up knee-deep in money, hoods, drug sales, dancers, and then blood as in succession four of his dancers are murdered, three of them on the stage itself (one is beheaded). Will Kay understand when she comes east and finds a naked dancer waiting on the couch? And when the papers shout PRIEST RAN TOPLESS MURDER BAR, will the church understand?

These obscure the struggling persons at the center of the argument - it causes those who oppose homosexual behavior to "lose sight of individual struggles, pain and faces". Writing with both an evangelical Christian perspective and profound empathy, Schmidt addresses all the main points of the current debate: what the Bible really says (and means) about homosexuality, the health effects of homosexual behavior, whether or not people are born with homosexual orientations, and the cogency of recent progay reconstructions of history, including John Boswell's. With arguments thoroughly researched and up to date, Straight &amp; Narrow? takes its place as the most comprehensive, persuasive and readable Christian book now available on the subject.Thomas E.

(1914-1948) was born and raised in Indiana, graduating from Indiana University. In 1937 he married his high-school sweetheart and they had four children. He is most noted for <i>Raintree County</i>, often considered one of the great American novels. Suffering from profound, and largely unrecognized, depression, he committed suicide two months after the novel's publication. His obituary appeared on the front page of the <i>New York Times</i>.In this forgotten classic--the only novel written by its author--John Shawnessy recalls his life during a single day in 1892. Reflecting on the paradisiacal world of Raintree County, Indiana, Shawnessy relives the pivotal moments of his life, from his youth to the Civil War to his adult years. Lloyd James does a wonderful job reading this book, providing an excellent narrative and a wide range of voices for the various characters.

It examines the ways culture travels&#x2014;how it is produced, transformed, adapted, absorbed, sold, and consumed; how it is shaped by audiences and politics, and controlled by laws and conventional morality; and why some countries excel in particular genres.

But in this groundbreaking work, Jeff Pollard challenges us to embrace God&#39;s standard and to understand the historical roots of the rise of nudity and immodesty in modern culture. His perspective is thoughtful and balanced. Most importantly, he accomplishes what few authors on this subject have achieved: a treatise that avoids both license and legalism.

A chance viewing of an "adult" film called Throat Sprockets transforms his notion of sexuality and, thereby, his identity. From then on his life revolves around this elusive film, his desire to see it again and his lust to share in the passions it records. The narrator's obsession (which may be guessed at from the book's title) is not one that the average reader is likely to share, but first novelist Lucas has more in mind here. The larger issue is the power of film, and it is explored amidst frequently striking images and turns of phrase. Though he is limited to words in describing what is primarily a visual experience, Lucas's implicit proposition-that a director could willfully manipulate his audience to a dire degree-is successfully and somewhat frighteningly supported by the unfolding drama of this novel. The narrator accuses: "What had been done to me [by the film] had been no accident. It had been nothing less than a conscious and deliberate act of terrorism"; and he is not the lone victim. Lucas allows parody to intrude when he depicts the spreading "sprocketing" subculture as the subject of an inflammatory talk show. Rare slips aside, Lucas has created a grippingly twisted tale of a mind and soul ensnared. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Gentlemen&#39;s Alliance Cross, Vol. 6</h2><p>From the creator of <b><i>Full Moon o Sagashite</i></b><br><br>Please note: Reads Right to Left (Japanese Style)<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>In return for a business loan of 50 million yen, the prestigious Kamiya family gave their daughter Haine away to the Otomiya family.

One, objective in its aspirations and inspired by biological disciplines, seeks explanation and is concerned to discover laws and causes. The other, subjective in its orientation and influenced by philosophy, linguistics, and the humatities, attempts interpretation and seeks to elucidate meanings. I take any raditcal separation of the two to be misguided, for the relationship between tem, with all of its difficulty, ambiguity, and tension, is a reflection of, or metaphor for, the condition of a species that lives in terms of meanings in a physical world devoid of intrinsic meaning but subject to causal law. The concept of adaptatioon when applied to human society must take account of meaning as well as cause, and of the complex dynamic of their relationship.&#34; -from the book.</p><p>"While many anthropologists of various epistemological persuasions would perhaps dismiss such topics as the business of priests rather than of scientists, Rappaport correctly perceives that the problem of man's religious consciousness is not only a legitimate object of anthropological study, it might well be the most critical test to which any cultural theory can be put. In Rappaport's essays, we see this test applied with studious logic, empirical relevance, and consistent regard to the naturalistic assumptions of ecological and evolutionary theory."<br>-Donal F.

Despite some early close shaves with a number of diverse career paths, ranging from gravedigging to professional football, it was music that truly captured his heart - and he never looked back.Rod started out in the early 1960s, playing the clubs on London's R&amp;B scene, before his distinctively raspy voice caught the ear of the iconic front man Long John Baldry, who approached him while busking one night on a railway platform. Stints with pioneering acts like the Hoochie Coochie Men, Steampacket, and the Jeff Beck Group soon followed, paving the way into a raucous five years with the Faces, the rock star's rock band, whose offstage antics with alcohol, wrecked hotel rooms and groupies have become the stuff of legend.And during all this, he found a spare moment to write 'Maggie May', among a few others, and launch a solo career that has seen him sell an estimated 200 million records, be inducted into the Hall of Fame twice, and play the world's largest ever concert. Not bad, as he says, for a guy with a frog in his throat.And then, there is his not-so-private life: marriages, divorces and affairs with some of the world's most beautiful women - Bond girls, movie stars and supermodels - and a brush with cancer which very nearly saw it all slip away.Rod's is an incredible life, and here, thrillingly and for the first time, he tells the whole thing, leaving no knickers under the bed. A rollicking rock 'n' roll adventure that is at times deeply moving, this is the remarkable journey of a guy with one hell of a voice - and one hell of a head of hair.<br></p><p><p>ROD STEWART is a two-time Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame inductee and a Grammy Living Legend.&nbsp; In a career spanning five decades, he has sold more than 150 million records and continues to be one of the top-grossing and most beloved live performers in the world. In 2007, the Queen of England bestowed him the prestigious CBE (Commander of the British Empire) for his contributions to music. He lives with his wife, Penny Lancaster, and children in Beverly Hills, California and Epping, Essex.</p><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>&#x201c;Funny, self-deprecating and a whole lot less boastful than he could be, Mr. Stewart offers a string of Grade-A rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; roll debauchery stories and...makes them charming.&#x201d; <b>&#x2013;</b><i><b>The New York Times&nbsp;<br></b></i><br>&#x201c;The best news about Stewart&#x2019;s autobiography is that it revives the rollicking humor and self-deprecating personality of his early career.

Wilson begins with his darkest days, in November 1982. Then, weighing over 340 pounds, smoking six packs of cigarettes and snorting five grams of coke a day, failing to bathe for weeks at a time, ``I stank. I was dirty...I was insane.'' How did the founder of ``America's band'' reach this bottom? According to the equally frank life-review that follows, father Murry Wilson, a would-be but talentless composer, had a lot to do with it, taking out his frustrations on his sensitive son (born in 1942) through mind- twisting beatings and ridicule. And then there were the drugs and the relentless pressure to produce hit tunes; by the late 60's, Wilson, wealthy and renowned for such songs as ``Good Vibrations'' and ``I Get Around,'' was drifting into a paranoid schizophrenia that would envelop him for 15 years. Salvation finally came in the person of Eugene Landy, an unorthodox psychologist who took Wilson by the hand in 1983 and turned his life around through a rigorous program of diet, exercise, and therapy. Wilson devotes nearly half of his text to his resurrection, and it's an inspiring story (although recent moves by the other Beach Boys to sever him from Landy--for reasons Wilson ascribes to greed and jealousy--find the self-admittedly ``brain-damaged'' author unsure about his mental future). Most readers, though, will find of even greater interest Wilson's detailing of his early encounters with the Beatles, Elvis, and other rock luminaries; of his stormy relationship with the other Beach Boys; of his now-dead brother Dennis's ties to Charlie Manson; and, in a recurrent motif that illuminates his troubled tale, of how he goes about composing his exquisite music. A bold and genuinely affecting account by a founding father of rock 'n' roll: a must for popular-music fans. (Fifty-plus b&amp;w photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This autobiography by the creative force of the Beach Boys follows Wilson's quick rise to worldwide fame, his descent into drug-assisted psychosis, and his subsequent (yet shaky) recovery. Coauthor Gold's background as a writer for People magazine is evidenced by individuals occasionally managing to somehow "laugh" or "shrug" an entire sentence. The book is effective in two areas, however. First, Wilson successfully evokes the pain caused by his estrangement from family and band members (his ex-wife refused to cooperate in the writing of the book, as did Beach Boys Mike Love and Carl Wilson, respectively Brian's cousin and brother). Second, the psychologist Eugene Landy, popularly perceived as an evil Svengali, is portrayed as a possible charlatan who nevertheless helped Wilson enormously. While this autobiography is as predictable as the C-Am-F-G7 chord progression, many fans of the Beach Boys will want to read this book and most won't be disappointed.

But this did not eliminate social hierarchies; instead, it redefined racial categories as cultural differences, such as differences in education or manners. In <i>Indigenous Mestizos </i> Marisol de la Cadena traces the history of the notion of race from this turn-of-the-century definition to a hegemony of racism in Peru.<p></p><p>De la Cadena&#x2019;s ethnographically and historically rich study examines how indigenous citizens of the city of Cuzco have been conceived by others as well as how they have viewed themselves and places these conceptions within the struggle for political identity and representation. Demonstrating that the terms <i>Indian</i> and <i>mestizo</i> are complex, ambivalent, and influenced by social, legal, and political changes, she provides close readings of everyday concepts such as marketplace identity, religious ritual, grassroots dance, and popular culture, as well as of such common terms as <i>respect</i>, <i>decency</i>, and <i>education</i>. She shows how <i>Indian</i> has come to mean an indigenous person without economic and educational means&#x2014;one who is illiterate, impoverished, and rural. <i>Mestizo</i>, on the other hand, has come to refer to an urban, usually literate, and economically successful person claiming indigenous heritage and participating in indigenous cultural practices. De la Cadena argues that this version of de-Indianization&#x2014;which, rather than assimilation, is a complex political negotiation for a dignified identity&#x2014;does not cancel the economic and political equalities of racism in Peru, although it has made room for some people to reclaim a decolonized Andean cultural heritage.</p><p>This highly original synthesis of diverse theoretical arguments brought to bear on a series of case studies will be of interest to scholars of cultural anthropology, postcolonialism, race and ethnicity, gender studies, and history, in addition to Latin Americanists.</p></p><p>&#x201c;Eloquent, engaging, and highly readable.

It has a reputation as a dry and difficult subject, a glorified form of geometry complicated by tedious computation. In this book, Eli Maor draws on his remarkable talents as a guide to the world of numbers to dispel that view. Rejecting the usual arid descriptions of sine, cosine, and their trigonometric relatives, he brings the subject to life in a compelling blend of history, biography, and mathematics. He presents both a survey of the main elements of trigonometry and a unique account of its vital contribution to science and social development. Woven together in a tapestry of entertaining stories, scientific curiosities, and educational insights, the book more than lives up to the title <i>Trigonometric Delights.</i></p><p>Maor, whose previous books have demystified the concept of infinity and the unusual number "e," begins by examining the "proto-trigonometry" of the Egyptian pyramid builders. He shows how Greek astronomers developed the first true trigonometry. He traces the slow emergence of modern, analytical trigonometry, recounting its colorful origins in Renaissance Europe's quest for more accurate artillery, more precise clocks, and more pleasing musical instruments. Along the way, we see trigonometry at work in, for example, the struggle of the famous mapmaker Gerardus Mercator to represent the curved earth on a flat sheet of paper; we see how M. C. Escher used geometric progressions in his art; and we learn how the toy Spirograph uses epicycles and hypocycles.</p><p>Maor also sketches the lives of some of the intriguing figures who have shaped four thousand years of trigonometric history. We meet, for instance, the Renaissance scholar Regiomontanus, who is rumored to have been poisoned for insulting a colleague, and Maria Agnesi, an eighteenth-century Italian genius who gave up mathematics to work with the poor--but not before she investigated a special curve that, due to mistranslation, bears the unfortunate name "the witch of Agnesi." The book is richly illustrated, including rare prints from the author's own collection. <i>Trigonometric Delights</i> will change forever our view of a once dreaded subject.</p></p><p><p>"If you think trigonometry has no more surprises for you, read <i>Trigonometric Delights</i>. Eli Maor will change your mind. The book presents the subject and its history the way they should be presented--it's a delight to read."--<b>Paul J. Nahin, author of <i>Duelling Idiots and Other Probability Puzzlers</i></b></p> <p>"This book will appeal to a general audience interested in the history of mathematics. I highly recommend [it] to teachers who would like to ground their lessons in the sort of mathematical investigations that were undertaken throughout history."--<b>Richard S. Kitchen, Mathematics Teacher</b></p> <p>"[Maor] writes enthusiastically and engagingly. . . . Delightful reading from cover to cover. Trigonometric Delights is a welcome addition."--<b>Sean Bradley, Mathematical Association of America</b></p> <p>"Here is trigonometry viewed through the lens of history--a rich, intriguing book that will leave readers shouting for Maor."--<b>William Durham, author of <i>The Mathematical Universe</i>.</b></p> <p>"Maor eases the reader from the mathematical puzzles of the Rhind Papyrus all the way to infinite series and the analysis of music produced by vibrating strings. Along the course, he leads a grand tour of the lovely but often neglected area of mathematics called trigonometry."--<b>Jerry P. King, Professor of Mathematics at Lehigh University</b></p> <p>"This is a rich and challenging book that will appeal to mathematicians and should help attract a newer generation to the subject. By putting the history back into trigonometry, Maor tells the many stories of trigonometry, and shows that what is often regarded as a collection of dry techniques is really a marvelous testament to thousands of years of human ingenuity and intellectual creativity."--<b>Keith Devlin, author of <i>Mathematics: The Science of Patterns</i> and <i>Goodbye Descartes</i></b></p><b>Eli Maor</b> teaches the history of mathematics at Loyola University in Chicago.

She lives in Pennsylvania.1<br><br>Everyday Garments<br><br>Made it? Flaunt it! Crocheted clothes are not just for special occasions. If you crochet, then you can make garments to wear every day using the yarns you love. "Who would want to?" you ask. Well, think about it. You can't deny there's a great deal of pride and satisfaction in crocheting something, anything. To some extent we all seek the admiration, approval, and dumbstruck awe that skillfully crocheted objects inspire. But how many admirers can there be for pretty afghans and decorative items that stay at home? Or for those gorgeous but frivolous accessories you adore wearing, but that only come out during the holidays?<br><br>I see many possible reasons for not putting your yarn stash on your back more often. Never crocheted a garment before? We will fix that. Haven't met the right crochet design? Maybe we can fix that. Can't find patterns in your size? Ditto. Think you can't wear or don't look good in crochet? It's not you, it's the crocheted garment that's either too clunky and thick, isn't your size, or has no shape. We can fix that, too. Aren't sure how to mix crochet with your own clothes? I can't give you a makeover, but I hope the photos of crochet plus wardrobe staples will give you some ideas.<br><br>Extra Sizing Spoken Here<br><br>Nobody, no body is perfect. To be human-especially to be a human woman-is to have bulges. From birth we are told that some bulges are sexy and desirable, worthy of flaunting, while some other bulges are unsightly, best kept disguised. Who made those rules? How are we supposed to maintain any kind of self-esteem when our fashion icons are size 4 and the average American woman is size 14?<br><br>I am ashamed to admit that I totally bought into this worship of the slender. Until very recently I hadn't even considered sizing my designs larger than XL, with a finished bust around 44" (112cm). And for the most part, the editors and publishers for whom I designed were not much concerned about it. Today I am acutely aware of the need for good crochet design for other than tiny model figures. But, be assured, this book isn't for large sizes only. Every garment here is offered from small (to fit busts sized 32-34" [81-84cm]) through extra sizing (to fit busts up to 50" [127cm]), and some larger still. Many designs are Petite-able and Tall-able. If we aren't encouraged to rejoice in our various bulges, at least we can dress them in crochet.<br><br>This book is about options. Each of the following design chapters offers a basic clothing item, then runs through a gang of variations on the theme. Your perfect sweater probably won't be like any of the samples I have crocheted, because you are going to shop for the bits to do for yourself, sort of one from column A, one from column B. Add up the parts you want for the silhouette that works best for your body, whatever your size.<br><br>The Dreaded Raglan<br><br>Understand that I design garments from the neck down with raglan-type increases in pattern to shape the shoulders and arms. Many readers will appreciate my MO for the technical crochet aspects but will immediately dismiss the thought of raglans as intrinsically unattractive. And normally that'd be correct. Most real figures will look best in a shoulder that's more structured, with a defined shoulder line and set-in sleeves. But in order to hang properly and look good, structured garments require precise calculation of various slopes, perfect placement of the shoulder seam, and skillful seaming.<br><br>I never enjoyed crocheting garments this way because of the sewing. It's not that I dislike or disapprove of sewing or seaming in crochet; it's more that I've always been so lousy at it. And as for sewn raglan seams in crochet, they're the most horrible, unyielding, bulky, constricting, and restricting style imaginable. This raglan's different. This raglan is a gentle, almost invisible (or very pretty where perceptible) line of increasing stitch pattern. It creates a smooth, flexible, shapely shoulder that allows the fabric to stretch, drape, and mold to the wearer in ways a more structured garment could never hope to do.<br><br>Of course, there's no guarantee that it will look good on everyone. But I know for a fact that it is flattering on many who have worn my garments, and I hope you will at least give it a try.<br><br>What's Up with All the Shells?<br><br>Crocheted shells possess many unique qualities. The nature of a shell, consisting of multiple tall stitches all made in one spot, is that it wants to expand. I exploit this tendency by crocheting shell fabric from the top down. If allowed, the shells across any row tend toward maximum entropy by spilling out horizontally. Normally, each successive row or round of shell stitch pattern keeps this tendency in check, resulting in a straight, in-line piece of fabric.<br><br>However, if crocheted in a relaxed enough gauge, that room for expansion is always present-lurking. So, for instance, the shell may stay quietly in place, flat and perfect, going down the middle of the back. It may stretch out long and lean at the waistline, at the middle of your sleeve, or at the diagonal of a raglan shaping. Or it may give up its full potential for width around the top of the arm, across the bust and hip. Left unchecked, shells will make beautiful flares at the lower edges of your garment. Without much ado, you're creating a gentle bell at the bottom of your sleeve, a bit of room over the top of your hip where your sweater stops, and a bit of an A- line at the hem of your skirt or dress. This self-molding aspect of shells cannot truly manifest when you work from the bottom up.<br><br>Shaping shells is at times complex. There are the problems of how to fit them in, how to pick the pattern back up when the work has changed, and how to achieve the most elegant shaping within the amount of space available. Agonizingly, there is no magic formula-no brilliant algorithm that will give you the perfect number of increases and rows for every application. The more you mess around with your own pattern shaping, the more you come to realize how much variation there can be from stitch pattern to stitch pattern, from yarn to yarn, even from a yarn worked firmly to the same yarn worked loosely. No worries! Enabled by years of trial and error and a tiny bit of math, I have crunched the numbers for the designs in this book. Once you get the hang of increasing one flavor of shell, you should find shaping the shell variation in the next project much easier.<br><br>Substituting Yarns? Just Do It<br><br>Criticism of crocheted garments stems from outdated perceptions. It is true that once upon a time we were offered only pot holder fabric to wear-heavy, lifeless synthetic yarns worked with undersized hooks into clunky, frumpy garments. It is still assumed crocheters do not, will not, or cannot work with good yarns or luxury fibers, even when we can afford the cost. I was shocked and dismayed in a local yarn shop when I overheard a customer inquiring if she could crochet with a particularly lovely yarn labeled for knitting and being told no.<br><br>That customer should have been assured that any yarn that can be knitted can be crocheted. Anything you can wrap around your hook can be crocheted, including string, fabric, trash bags, wire, fishing line, or Twizzlers (don't ask!). Modern science has removed the stigma from synthetics. There are high-quality polyester and acrylic microfibers available. In a blend, microfiber adds strength, durability, softness, and sheen and takes away excess weight. The trendiest new yarns come from the fields, made from bamboo, soy, corn, and Tencel (derived from trees). The fineness, hand, and color properties of these alternative fibers rival those of silk, and can be found at a fraction of the cost.<br><br>Personally, I love messing with all kinds of yarns and fibers. I have my favorites as, I imagine, do you. For the purposes of this book I restricted the texture, color, and weight range of the yarns. I chose mostly smooth or slightly textured yarns so that the stitch patterns and the shape of the garments would come through. To keep the largest size garments from weighing a ton, I went no thicker than medium to heavy worsted weight, leaving the bulky and super-bulky yarns for belts.<br><br>Each of the design chapters begins with a Yarn Note that gives general guidelines for the most appropriate yarn weights. Then, for each pattern, I list the specific yarn and amounts used. I encourage you to substitute your favorite yarn or combination of yarns and colors. You want it in black? Make it in black. As long as you can achieve the stated gauge, switching hooks if needed, just do it.<br><br>If you're an adventurous soul and are willing to live with the results, you can break the strict gauge rule. I gauged up (used a larger hook and thicker yarn) on purpose to turn a pullover design into a heavier coat and loved it so much I put it in this book (see Shannon, page TK). But for the most part, try to stay close to the given gauge for each design, because when you stray too far, the proportions start to get hinky.<br><br>How do you know if your favorite yarn is the right weight? Annoyingly, not all yarns are labeled with either the CYCA standard ball band symbols (see Abbreviations and Symbols, page TK) or any hint at crochet gauge. If the label on the yarn you want to use is naked, it is possible to interpret the knitting gauge, which mysteriously enough most labels seem to have, and match that to a ball band symbol on the CYCA chart for the yarn weight. I may refer to knitting gauges when talking about what yarns are right for what designs as a further aid in identifying appropriate yarn weights.<br><br>To estimate how much of your choice of yarn you will need, look at the yarn listing info for a specific sample, and multiply the yardage by the number of balls or hanks needed. That's approximately how many yards it takes. Have on hand that many yards of your yarn, with extra for insurance, especially if you want to lengthen or alter.<br><br>Bear in mind that when you swap out yarns there may be unexpected consequences. There's no way I can predict for you how your yarn will react, finish, and block when it's done. The biggest glitch will be length. Often you can match the stitch gauge but not the row gauge. You can still make the pattern, but be prepared to adjust the length. Some of the other proportions may be affected, but not to the point where your results become unwearable.<br><br>Have a Fit<br><br>The most significant decision you will make is which pattern size to crochet, and for that you have to know yourself. It might seem as if choosing your size would be a simple matter. Unfortunately, this is never the case. My patterns do not conform to standard sweater sizes, such as S, M, L, or XL, or to American dress sizes such as 8, 10, 12, or 14. I use instead the finished garment bust measurement as the size. Due to the difference in stitch pattern width, the sizes may jump by as little as two inches (5cm) and as many as five inches (12.5cm) to the next size. How do you choose the right size? Each design chapter begins with a Size Finder, but here are general guidelines:<br><br>Measure your bust around the fullest part, wearing the bra you'd wear with the garment, one that fits properly. If you feel the crochet stitches in my designs are too open and revealing to wear over just a bra, then invest in camisoles with honest support-a built-in real bra, not the ones with bits of elastic called a shelf bra.<br><br>Next, focus on how you like your clothes to fit. Take out your favorite sweater and measure it. If you wear your sweaters small and snug, your size will be close to or smaller than your actual bust measurement. Want an oversized vest to layer over a sweatshirt? Choose the size that is your bust measurement plus a few inches of ease.<br><br>Begin with a design that is appropriate for your figure. My clothes are meant to be relaxed, made without much fussy fitting, but that does not mean they are all boxy or have no shape. I wish you could see and handle the fabric of each sample to realize how beautifully it will drape on the body. The piece should skim over your curves, taking its shape from your own. Note that I don't offer any waist shaping in these designs. If you want to emphasize a tiny waist, or suggest a waist where there is none, try belting a longer cami or pullover top or place a closure at the waist of an open-front style to nip it in.<br><br>Read the instructions, paying particular attention to any adjustment points. You are responsible for making these adjustments (or not) for your figure. The following will be most common.<br><br>Bust Short Rows: This adjustment adds a bit of fabric length to cover your bust while leaving the overall bust measurement the same. You know why we do this if you are constantly tugging at your top to keep it down in front. Most designs here offer this interior shaping, placed 11D2-21D2" (3.8-5cm) lower than the joining at underarms, 1-2"(2.5-5cm) in from the center at each side. This adjustment might not be enough for truly ample bust lines (bra cup sizes larger than DD). Your best option would be to size up.<br><br>Hip Shaping: Many women have told me that they could wear a size 14, but because of their hips they have to go up to a 16. It may not be an issue with shorter tops that end above the widest part of the hip, but for longer styles, if your hips are larger than the size you want to make for your bust measurement, consider doing hip shaping where offered. Also try side vents for added ease.<br><br>Sleeve Width: Due to the limitations imposed by the stitch patterns, the sleeves jump in width, with the smallest size being a bit tighter and the largest sizes looser than standard. So even when the design calls for a full-width sleeve, made straight down the length of the arm, I suggest tapering the upper arm in the largest sizes for a neater appearance and less bulk. See specific instructions for each design.<br><br>Sleeve Length: Shorten or lengthen the sleeve at the adjustment point. Feel free to make your sleeves whatever length you like-short, half, three-quarter, full-length-on any of the designs with sleeves. The raglan construction makes a yoke with a slightly capped shoulder, so any sleeveless option is actually a tiny cap sleeve. You can turn any style sleeveless by working only the first round of sleeve and ending there. My only suggestion is to not end a short sleeve right at the widest part of your bust.</p><h2>Behind the Scenes: Formerly a slave, but more recently modiste, and friend to Mrs. Lincoln; or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the White House</h2><p>Born into slavery, Elizabeth Hobbs Keckley rose to a position of respect as a talented dressmaker and designer to the political elite of Washington, DC, and a confidante of First Lady, Mary Todd Lincoln. This memoir offers a behind-the-scenes view of the formal and informal networks that African Americans established among themselves.</p><p>Only a few years later, however, that relationship was in ruins, when this 1868 book created a scandal. Intended by Keckley to rehabilitate the reputation of the former First Lady--who had run up extensive debts on clothing and other luxuries while in the White House, and found herself unable to repay them after the President's assassination--the book was perceived instead as a betrayal of friendship. <p> Perhaps one of the first examples of celebrity gossip publishing gone awry, Behind the Scenes does, nevertheless, offer an insider perspective on the Lincoln White House that will intrigue armchair historians and fans of biography alike.</p>Elizabeth Hobbs Keckley</p><h2>Unclaimed (HQN)</h2><p><br><br><strong><em>Her only hope for survival...</em></strong><br><br>Handsome, wealthy and respected, Sir Mark Turner is the most sought-after bachelor in all of London&#x2014;and he's known far and wide for his irreproachable character.

Before she started writing historical romance, she experimented with various occupations: computer programming, dog-training, scientificating...

When she's not reading (lots), writing (lots), or sleeping (not enough), she can be found in the vicinity of a classroom.<br><br><em>London June, 1841</em><br><br>Sir Mark Turner did not look like any virgin that Jessica had ever seen before.<br><br>Perhaps, she mused, it was because he was surrounded by women.<br><br>The uneven glass of the taproom window obscured the tableau unfolding across the street. Not that she would have been able to see anything, even had she been standing in the muck of the road. After all, it had taken less than a minute for the mob to form. The instant Sir Mark had come out the door across the way, a carriage had come to an abrupt halt. A pair of young ladies had spilled out, tugged along by an eager chaperone. Two elderly matrons, strolling along the gangway, had laid eyes on him a few moments later and darted in front of a cart with surprising speed.<br><br>The oldest woman now had one clawed hand on the cuff of his greatcoat and the other on her cane&#x2014;and she was merely the most aggressive of his hangers-on. Sir Mark was thronged on all sides by women...and the occasional man, sporting one of those ridiculous blue rose cockades on his hat. Jessica could see nothing of him through the crowd but the gray of his coat and a glint of golden hair. Still, she could imagine him flashing that famous smile reproduced in woodcuts in all the newspapers: a confident, winning grin, as if he were aware that he was the most sought-after bachelor in London.<br><br>Jessica had no desire to join the throng around Sir Mark. She had no autograph book to wave at him, and the likes of her wouldn't have been welcomed in any event.<br><br>Sir Mark handled the crowd well. He didn't bask in the attention, as the men of Jessica's acquaintance might have done. Neither did he shrink from the pressing women. Instead, he ordered them about with an air of gentle command&#x2014;signing the little books with a pencil he produced from a pocket, shaking hands&#x2014;all the while making his way inexorably toward the street corner, where a carriage stood.<br><br>When Jessica thought of virgins, she imagined youths plagued by red spots or youngsters who wore thick spectacles and spoke with a stammer. She didn't think of blond men with clean-shaven, angular faces. She certainly didn't imagine tall fellows whose smiles lit up the dark, rainy street. It all went to show: Jessica knew nothing of virgins.<br><br>Hardly a surprise. She'd not spoken to a single one, not in all her years in London.<br><br>Beside her, George Weston let out a snort. "Look at him," he scoffed. "He's acting like a damned jackanapes&#x2014;parading up and down the street as if he owned the place.''<br><br>Jessica traced her finger against the window. In point of fact, Sir Mark's brother, newly the Duke of Parford, <em>did</em> own half the buildings on the street. It would annoy Weston if she corrected him, and so for a moment, she considered doing so.<br><br>But then, Sir Mark's presence was irritation enough. Some days, it seemed as if every society paper in London sent out a new issue every time he sneezed. Not much of an exaggeration. How many times had she passed post-boys waving scandal sheets, headlines a half-page high declaring: <em>Sir Mark: Threatened by Illness?</em><br><br>"He must think," Weston continued, "that just because his brother is a duke&#x2014;" he spat those words "&#x2014;and the Queen has shown him a little favor, that he can caper about, displacing everyone who stands as his better. Did you know they're considering him for Commissioner?"<br><br>Jessica slanted him another glance. No; no need to rile the man. He could work himself into a lather without any help from her, and for now, she still needed him.<br><br>"He's never had to try for anything," Weston groused. "It just falls in his lap. And here I've been running myself ragged, trying to put myself forward. Lefevre's spot was practically <em>promised</em> to me. But no&#x2014;now it's Turner's for the asking."<br><br>Sir Mark reached his carriage. He smiled to one and all. Even inside the taproom, Jessica could hear the cries of disappointment as a footman closed the carriage door.<br><br>"I don't understand how he became such a darling of London society," Weston vented. "Would you believe that they've tapped him for the office not because he has any administrative experience, but because they wish to increase public approval? Why everyone cares about <em>him,</em> I can't understand. He's unwilling to engage in even the most time-honored gentlemanly pursuits."<br><br>By which Weston undoubtedly meant drinking and wenching.<br><br>"He wrote a book." Jessica pressed her hands against her skirt. Understatement served her purposes better than truth. "It has enjoyed a run of some little popularity."<br><br>"Don't start on the bloody <em>Gentleman's Guide,"</em> Weston growled. "And don't mention the bloody MCB, either. That man is a <em>plague</em> on my house."<br><br>Before Sir Mark's conveyance could spirit him away, the footmen had to politely clear the crowd from in front of the horses. The carriage was closed, but through a window on the side that faced her, Jessica could see Sir Mark's silhouette. He removed his hat and bowed his head. It was a posture halfway between despair and exhaustion.<br><br>So. All those smiles and handshakes were false. Good. A man who put on one false front would put on another, and if all his vaunted moral superiority was an act, it would make Jessica's work very, very easy. Besides, if Sir Mark despaired over a little thing like a mob determined to pay him adulation, he deserved what was coming to him. One paid a price for popularity.<br><br>And Sir Mark's book had been very popular indeed. The Queen had read it, and had knighted its author for his contribution to popular morality. Thereafter, his work had been read in all the favored salons in London. Every Sunday sermon quoted passages from the <em>Gentleman's Guide.</em> Why, just last month, a diminutive version had been printed, so that women could carry his words about in their skirt pockets&#x2014;or in intimate compartments sewn into their petticoats for just that purpose.<br><br>There was something rather ironic, Jessica thought, about proper young ladies carrying <em>A Gentleman's Practical Guide to Chastity</em> as near to their naked thighs as they could manage.<br><br>But women were not his only devotees. Some days, it seemed as if half the men of London had joined that benighted organization of his followers. They were everywhere on the streets these days, with their blue cockades and their supposedly secret hand signals. Sir Mark had done the impossible. He'd made chastity <em>popular.</em><br><br>Beside her, Weston watched with narrowed eyes as the carriage finally started up. The coachman flicked his whip, and the conveyance moved slowly through the gathered crowd. He shook his head and turned to consider Jessica. It was only in her imagination that his eyes left a rancid, oily film behind.<br><br>"I don't suppose you asked me here just so I could talk about the insufferable Mark Turner." His eyes fell to her bosom in idle, lecherous speculation. "I told you you'd miss me, Jess. Come. Tell me about this.this <em>proposition</em> of yours."<br><br>He took her arm; she gritted her teeth at the touch of his fingers and managed not to flinch.<br><br>She hated that appellation. <em>Jess</em> sounded like a falcon's leash, as if she were captured and hooded and possessed by him. She'd hated it ever since she realized she <em>had</em> been pinioned&#x2014;tamed, taught commands and trotted out on the occasions when he needed to make use of her. But she had hardly been in a position to object to his use of it.<br><br><em>Someday. Someday soon.</em> It was not a promise she made as he led her to the table in the back room. It was a last breath of hope, whispered into darkness.<br><br>Jessica sat in the chair that Weston pulled up for her.<br><br>Six months ago, she'd sent him on his way. She'd thought she would never have to see him again. If her plan succeeded now, she would not have to. She would be free from Weston and London...and this life in its entirety.<br><br>Weston took his seat at the head of the table. Jessica stared across at him. She had never loved him, but for a while, he had been tolerable. Neither generous nor overly demanding. He had kept her safe and clothed. She hadn't needed to pretend too hard; he'd not wanted her false protestations of affection.<br><br>"Well, Jess," Weston said. "Shall I ring for tea?"<br><br>At the words, her hands clenched around the sticky wood of the taproom table. She could feel each of her breaths, sharp inside her lungs. They labored in the cavern of her breast, as if she were climbing to the top of a tower. For just an instant, she felt as if she <em>had</em> ascended some great height&#x2014;as if this man was a small, distant specimen, viewed from on high. Reality seemed very far away.<br><br>What she managed to say was: "No tea."<br><br>"Oh." He glanced at her sidelong. "Ha. Right. I'd forgotten entirely. You're not still put out over <em>that,</em> are you?"<br><br>She had always thought that the life of a courtesan would take its toll slowly over time. That she might tolerate it for at least a decade to come, before her beauty slowly faded into age.<br><br>But no. Six months ago, her life had become unbearable over the course of one cup of tea. She didn't respond, and he sighed, slouching in his chair.<br><br>"Well, then. What is it you want?" he asked.<br><br>What she wanted sounded so simple. When she went outside, she wanted to feel the sunlight against her face.<br><br>She hadn't realized how bad matters had become until the first sunny day of spring had arrived. She'd gone outdoors&#x2014;had been chivied outside, in fact, by a friend&#x2014;to promenade in the park. She had felt nothing&#x2014;not inside her, nor out. She hadn't felt cold. She hadn't felt warm. And when the spring sun had hit her face, it had been nothing but pale light.<br><br>This man had made her into dark gray stone, from the surface of her skin to the center of her soul. No nerves. No hopes. No <em>future.</em><br><br>"I didn't come here to tell you what I want," she said firmly.<br><br>She wanted never again to have to fill another man's bed, telling falsehoods with her body until her mind could no longer track her own desires. She wanted to rid herself of the murk and the mire that had filled her. This life had bound her as effectively as if she were a falcon tied by a leather shackle, and she wanted to be free.<br><br>She steepled her fingers. "You've offered a reward to the woman who seduces Sir Mark Turner."<br><br>These words had an immediate effect. Weston sucked his breath in. "How did you know that was me? I thought I kept that quiet." He looked at her. "It's supposed to be <em>quiet.</em> It's no good if I ruin the man at the expense of my own reputation."<br><br>She shrugged. "A little research. There's not much secrecy among courtesans."<br><br>"I shouldn't have bothered. A reward of three hundred pounds, and the finest whores in all of London have failed. Don't tell me <em>you're</em> thinking of taking him on, Jess."<br><br>She met his gaze without flinching.<br><br>"You <em>are</em> thinking of it." Weston's lip curled. "Of course you are. You're between protectors. Honestly, Jess. If you're that desperate for funds, I'll take you back."<br><br>After what he'd done to her six months ago, the offer should have made her skin crawl. As it was, the proposition felt like nothing more than the cold gray of shadow.<br><br>She should have yearned for justice. She should have wanted revenge. She should, at a minimum, have wanted to extract something from him, of a size and shape to fill the desolate wasteland of nothingness he'd left inside her.<br><br>But she'd learned years ago that there was no justice, not for a woman like her. There was no way to crawl backward, to unravel the harms that had been done. There were only small, timid paths to be found through tangled underbrush. If you were lucky, you might hit upon one and escape the dark forest.<br><br>"It happens," she said, "that I have something none of those other women had."<br><br>Weston rubbed his chin. "Well, what is it?"<br><br><em>Desperation,</em> she thought.<br><br>But what she said was, "Information. Sir Mark is returning to his boyhood home for the summer&#x2014;a small market town called Shepton Mallet. I gather he wants to escape the adoring throngs for a period. He'll be away from his loving public. Staying, not in his brother's mansion, packed with servants, but in an isolated house, with only a few villagers to come by and take care of his needs."<br><br>"That's not precisely a secret."<br><br>"With nobody watching him, he'll have the opportunity to stray from his righteous path. He wouldn't dare, here in London&#x2014;he's the center of everyone's attention. Out there...?" She trailed off suggestively. "At a very minimum, I should like the chance to try."<br><br></p><h2>Magnificent Tiffany Silver</h2><p>Tiffany &amp; Co., America's preeminent purveyor of jewels and luxury goods, has created extraordinary silver pieces since its founding in 1837.

Tour.</p><p>For most health books, the word <i>cure</i> in the title is a definite sign to steer clear. <i>The Diet Cure</i> is a refreshing exception. Author Julia Ross has the unusual job description of "nutritional psychologist," which means that she works with people to eradicate food cravings, addictions, and eating disorders (including overeating). The gist of <i>The Diet Cure</i> plan is that food allergies, hormonal irregularities, blood sugar swings, and thyroid dysfunction, among other factors, cause biochemical imbalances that lead to food addiction and weight gain, and that these problems can usually be lessened or eradicated with the proper diet and supplements.<p> To be sure, most of these health problems ought to be diagnosed by a medical professional, but they often get overlooked because their symptoms can be numerous and vague (fatigue, depression, inability to concentrate). They're not easily diagnosed by the common managed-care tests (such as the TSH, or thyroid-stimulating hormone, blood test; Ross advises several more specific tests if a thyroid problem is suspected). Ross's questionnaires, worksheets, and profiles of case studies from her 10 years of clinical experience will enable you to determine what may be the hidden causes that sabotage your weight-loss efforts.</p><p> Ross's book should be lauded for its educational tone. She warns of the dangers of zinc and vitamin B1 deficiencies, two common problems found in chronic dieters, along with protein and fat deficiencies and adrenal exhaustion (which is particularly common in caffeine fiends). She rails against the most popular diet programs, including the Zone, the Atkins Diet, and even Weight Watchers, for (among other things) their ignorance of food allergies such as grains, dairy products, and sugar. For those whom Ross terms, perhaps frighteningly, sugar addicts or "recreational sugar users," she suggests an amino-acid and fish-oil supplement plan to curb sugar cravings and aid weight loss.

So when he decided to tell the story of three Dubliners on one ordinary day, he loosely fashioned their wanderings after those in Homer&#39;s Odyssey. On June 16, 1904 (the date of Joyce&#39;s first walk with his future wife and now known as Bloomsday, Stephen Dedalus (standing in for Telemachus) and Leopold Bloom (Odysseus) traverse the city, visiting a newspaper office, a funeral, a library, several pubs, a hospital, and a brothel before eventually meeting. Bloom&#39;s wife, Molly (Penelope), waits at home, though with something less than the pure faithfulness of her prototype. Joyce sought to accurately convey his characters&#39; thoughts, and so relied on interior, stream-of-consciousness monologues to put the reader inside their often chaotic minds. At heart a comic writer, he also used parody, puns, and hyperbole to great effect. For its inventiveness, depth, and complexity, Ulysses is often nominated as the greatest novel in the English language.</p><p></p><h2>The Writer&#39;s Map: An Atlas of Imaginary Lands /anglais</h2><p>Maps can transport us, they are filled with wonder, the possibility of real adventure and travels of the mind. This is an atlas of the journeys that writers make, encompassing not only the maps that actually appear in their books, but also the many maps that have inspired them and the sketches that they use in writing. For some, making a map is absolutely central to the craft of shaping and telling their tale. A writer s map might mean also the geographies they describe, the worlds inside books that rise from the page, mapped or unmapped, and the realms that authors inhabit as they write. Philip Pullman recounts a map he drew for an early novel; Robert Macfarlane reflects on his cartophilia, set off by Robert Louis Stevenson and his map of Treasure Island; Joanne Harris tells of her fascination with Norse maps of the universe; Reif Larsen writes about our dependence on GPS and the impulse to map our experience; Daniel Reeve describes drawing maps and charts for The Hobbit trilogy of films; Miraphora Mina recalls creating The Marauder s Map for the Harry Potter films; David Mitchell leads us to the Mappa Mundi by way of Cloud Atlas and his own sketch maps. And there s much more besides. Amidst a cornucopia of images, there are maps of the world as envisaged in medieval times, as well as maps of adventure, sci-fi and fantasy, maps from nursery stories, literary classics, collectible comics a vast range of genres.</p><p></p><h2>The Making of the New Spirituality: The Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition</h2><p>A 2004 ECPA Gold Medallion Finalist! One of <em>Preaching</em> magazine's 2004 "Top Ten Books Every Preacher Should Read"! Neo-paganism.<br> The paranormal.<br> Astrology.<br> Nature religion.<br> Holistic thinking.<br> Healing.<br> New Age.<br> New spirituality. A massive shift in Western religious attitudes has taken place almost without our noticing it. The Judeo-Christian tradition of Western culture has slowly but steadily been eclipsed by a new way of viewing spirituality. This shift has been in the making for some three hundred years. James A. Herrick tells the story of how the old view has been dismantled and a new one created not primarily through academic or institutional channels but by means of popular religious media--books, speeches, magazines and pamphlets, as well as movies, plays, music, radio interviews, television programs and websites. Although the new spirituality is diffuse and eclectic in its sources and manifestations, Herrick demonstrates a significant convergence of ideas, beliefs, assumptions, convictions and images in the myriad ways this New Religious Synthesis makes its way into our culture. In fact, the new spirituality, says Herrick, directly calls into question each major tenet of Judeo-Christian tradition and so represents a radical alternative to it. Interest in spirituality increases while participation in institutional religion wanes. Many welcome this evolution of religion. However, few are familiar with its roots, and fewer still have critically examined its prospects. As we stand at a spiritual crossroad, Herrick questions whether we are wise to discard the Western religious tradition and adopt the new spirituality.</p><p>James A. Herrick is Guy Vander Jagt Professor of Communication at Hope College in Holland, Michigan. He has also written <em>The Radical Rhetoric of the English Deists</em> (University of South Carolina Press), <em>Argumentation</em> (Strata), <em>The History and Theory of Rhetoric</em> (Allyn &amp; Bacon) and <em>The Making of the New Spirituality</em> (IVP Books)."A compelling analysis . . . must-reading for those of us who are called to engage our culture with the gospel." (The Discerning Reader)<br><br>"I think that this book should be considered must reading for all pastors and seminary students." (Ken Myers, Mars Hill Audio (July/August 2003; Volume 63))<br><br>"Herrick reminds us that the main opponent of Christianity today, especially in popular culture, is not secularism but New Age spiritualism. He offers a detailed taxonomy that will help readers trace the richly varied sources giving rise to the new synthesis of East and West." (Nancy R. Pearcey, Senior Fellow, The Discovery Institute, Center for Science and Culture)<br><br>"God is not dead in our culture. Only his identity has changed. The claim of autonomy for human reason has led to its own deification and the rejection of the importance of history, the development of a spiritualized physics and a return to an ancient gnosticism--in short, a New Religious Synthesis. The dominant god today is the cosmic spirit embodied in the self. Herrick shows us how this shift has come about. A lucid intellectual history with important implications for navigating the religious currents of our day." (James W. Sire, author of The Universe Next Door)<br><br>"Once in Western societies to be 'religious' was to be 'Christian.' Why that is no longer the case is the subject of James Herrick's compelling new book. It is a volume that both raises key questions and clarifies 'the spiritual' in an unusually helpful way." (Mark Noll, author of America's God: From Jonathon Edwards to Abraham Lincoln)<br><br>"This is an excellent overview of the development of Western religious thought and life that reveals the roots of much of 'modern spirituality.' As such it is a must-read for anyone who simply wants to understand the spiritual ferment all around us." (Irving Hexham, Professor, Department of Religious Studies, University of Calgary)<br><br>"James Herrick's book surveys a variety of spiritual movements subversive of traditional Christianity that often broadcast intoxicating messages of self-improvement and self-deification. . . . Herrick illuminates both the historical origins of these movements and the current scene in which they thrive so abundantly."

It is a known fact that when separated at birth, they will often end up with very similar lives, without ever having met one another. So it seems to follow that if one twins turns out to be a "bad seed," the other will also go to the dark side. the shocking stories in <i>Evil Twins </i>prove this to be the case time and time again. And even more astounding are stories of twins turning upon each other in furious rivalries that may date back to the womb.

Yet Greg and Jeff Henry were inseparable&#x2014;locked together in a sadomasochistic relationship that would end in a grisly death.It is a twisted tale of a strange, dysfunctional Southern family that could have come straight out of the pages of an Erskine Caldwell novel.Throughout their lives Greg delighted in intimidating and terrorizing his meeker brother, ordering him to fetch beer after beer and then clean up. To reinforce his dominance, Greg often fired his .22 caliber rifle at Jeff to scare him, spraying their apartment walls with bullet holes.The Henry brothers lived and worked together in a strange master&#x2014;slave relationship for nearly thirty-seven years, until they were ripped apart by a single shotgun blast at their home in rural Georgia.Killed instantly was Greg, the brutal power monger, who finally pushed things too far one night after a marathon drinking session, when he threatened Jeff with a shotgun. For once the docile brother turned, savagely killing his twin before giving himself up to the police and being charged with murder.<br>&nbsp;Even as babies, Greg and Jeff Henry faced an uphill battle for survival in a world they could never quite come to terms with. They were born on January 23, 1955, in Dublin, Georgia, during a freak snowstorm. It became a family joke that the real reason the town&#x2019;s antiquated switchboard broke down from too many calls wasn&#x2019;t the snow, but the arrival of the Henry twins.Their father, Dick Henry, was a successful executive, managing a local chemical plant, and their mother, Sue, once the most beautiful girl in Dublin, had won many local beauty contests in her youth.Dick and Sue, who already had two boys, were overjoyed when the twins were born after a difficult Cesarean section. But within a few months Greg became sick and almost died. He was diagnosed with a brain disorder and had to have his spine tapped to save his life.As infants, the Henry twins captured the imagination of the town. Sue, then thirty-six, would proudly push them through the streets to church every Sunday in their double stroller. And they caused quite a stir at Dick&#x2019;s country club, where they would play with their two older brothers, Chris and Mike.From the very beginning they were known as &#x201c;the twins&#x201d; and never referred to by their names. Even their mother couldn&#x2019;t tell them apart and would ask them to raise their shirts to identify them, as one had an inner bellybutton and the other, an outer.Sue Henry dressed them alike in fabulous no-expense-spared outfits and the twins became her pride and joy. She spoiled them rotten. As infants Jeff and Greg were inseparable and even sucked each other&#x2019;s thumbs. They played together and slept together and seemed like a single person inhabiting two identical bodies.&#x201c;If you had one, you had them both,&#x201d; declared their mother. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember them being any different.&#x201d;Even before they could talk English they had instinctively developed their own language, which no one else could understand. They would happily jabber away for hours, using strange words like &#x201c;Jogabawamama&#x201d; and &#x201c;Debogdoogwotama.&#x201d;But the Henrys&#x2019; perfect world fell apart when, in April 1958, Dick was diagnosed with brain cancer and died a year later. While he was on his deathbed, Sue brought Greg and Jeff into the hospital to say their final good-byes.&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t they adorable?&#x201d; said their dying father as he kissed them for the last time.So at the age of forty, Sue&#x2014;or Ma, as the twins called her&#x2014;found herself a widow with just a small trust fund to support the twins and their two brothers.&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a survivor,&#x201d; says the tough Southern belle, who became a secretary to make ends meet. &#x201c;You do what you have to do to get by.&#x201d;There seemed to be an almost supernatural, psychic bond between Jeff and Greg as they grew up. At the age of five Greg disappeared and couldn&#x2019;t be found anywhere. When Jeff was asked where his brother was hiding he immediately walked off and found him a mile away from their home. Somehow he was just drawn toward him.Together the twins created their own world of fantasy and didn&#x2019;t seem to need anyone else. But from their earliest days Greg appeared to dominate Jeff, assuming the role of leader in all their games. By the time they started at a private pre-school and kindergarten, Jeff cheerfully took a back seat to his more extroverted brother, who always got better grades and made more friends. And wherever Greg led, Jeff followed.From a young age the twins discovered a fascination for electrical appliances. When they were seven they surprised their mother by completely rewiring their bedroom, connecting every appliance to a single master switch so they could turn on everything at once.It inspired them to want to become inventors when they grew up and they started reading everything they could about technology.In 1962, Ma Henry remarried a local man named Jack Wright. The seven-year-old twins hated their new stepfather, a strict disciplinarian who tried to rein them in. Jeff and Greg considered him physically abusive and would avoid him at all costs.At home there were frequent arguments and fights between their mother and new stepfather, who did not get along. Ma Henry turned to drink to overcome her problems, finally divorcing Wright in 1973.Painfully shy and far slower than his smarter brother, Jeff struggled through Henderson High School as a &#x201c;C&#x201d;- and &#x201c;D&#x201d;-grade student. The introverted Jeff was physically frail and far weaker than Greg, and developed an inferiority complex after failing to have his brother&#x2019;s success with the girls.Jeff could barely read or write, but he found that he had a talent for fixing radios and stereos, spending hours happily tinkering away with the electronic devices. The tall, skinny teenager, who sported long, blond hair, dreamed of inventing revolutionary machines that would change the world, like the ones he read about in science fiction comics.Though they looked alike, the twins were as different as chalk and cheese. Unlike his nervous brother, Greg was a fearless daredevil. He loved racing his bicycle up and down the hallway of his high school, showing off to the other kids with his patented wheelies.During their late teens the twins fought over everything and had an increasingly troubled relationship. Greg seemed to enjoy humiliating his shy brother in public, ridiculing his whimsical ideas. But if Jeff ever dared to stand up for himself and criticize Greg, it always ended in a fight.&#x201c;They were going through that rebellion thing,&#x201d; their mother would later explain.The Henry family was torn apart when the twins&#x2019; eldest brother Richard was diagnosed with schizophrenia and hospitalized in the late 1960s. It had a profound effect on Jeff who began to fear insanity might run in the family.At the age of eighteen the twins graduated high school, finding jobs in the mailroom of a local company. Now that they were financially sufficient they left home to get an apartment together.Both standing six foot two inches and weighing just one hundred and sixty pounds, the wavy-haired, pencil-thin Henry twins were an imposing sight. Their fellow workers found it almost impossible to tell them apart, before getting to know them. Then it was easy to pick out Greg by his loud bullying ways as opposed to his quieter, more easy-going twin brother.&#x201c;We used to kid him and call him a little wimp,&#x201d; said Ma. &#x201c;He was so passive.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Two years after leaving high school, the twins were briefly separated for the only time in their life when Greg married his girlfriend, Julie. Jeff, who had never had a girlfriend of his own, couldn&#x2019;t bear to be apart from Greg and moved into the basement of the house the couple bought. But the marriage was short-lived and Jeff was overjoyed when Julie left and the twins were reunited.Taking a large apartment on Seville Drive in Clarkston, Georgia, Jeff and Greg decided to become rock stars. Greg bought a set of drums and Jeff tried to teach himself bass. They recruited a couple of friends to join their band, rehearsing late into the night in the basement of their new apartment.During band practices Jeff and Greg would down cases of Budweiser beer until they could hardly stand up. And the more beer Greg drank, the meaner he became to Jeff.Friend and fellow band member and Jason Hill remembers Greg Henry constantly picking fights with his weaker twin brother.&#x201c;When they weren&#x2019;t drinking they were pretty much normal,&#x201d; said Hill. &#x201c;But when they started drinking&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t mean a twelve-pack of beer but two or three cases&#x2014;Greg turned into a different person.&#x201d;The brothers were so proud of their drinking that they would save each empty beer case to stack up against the wall as trophies. And they delighted in proudly showing off their collection of empty beer &#x201c;suitcases&#x201d; that soon reached to the ceiling.Fueled by beer, Greg would pound his drums late into the night, refusing to allow the other band members to go home. On one occasion when Hill insisted on leaving at 2 a.m. so he could go to work the following morning, Greg flew into a rage, kicking his drum set across the floor.&#x201c;As we left you could hear Greg screaming at Jeff to carry on playing,&#x201d; remembered Hill. &#x201c;You would have to drag him off those drums to stop him.&#x201d;Greg Henry was often totally out of control, exploding at the slightest provocation. One night when the twins were staying with their mother, they started arguing so loudly that she asked them to be quiet.&#x201c;Greg gave me some lip,&#x201d; said Ma Henry. &#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t take lip off my sons. When I told him not to talk to me like that he picked up a clock radio and hurled it across the room and it broke. Then he just grabbed his stuff and got into his car and left.&#x201d;The growing tension between the twins escalated dramatically when they developed a fascination with firearms. They each bought themselves shotguns and proudly displayed them against the living room wall.Now Greg&#x2019;s anger took on a sinister dimension. To make a point in an argument with Jeff, he would suddenly grab his .22-caliber firearm and start shooting up the room in fury.Early one Sunday morning Jeff arrived at Jason Hill&#x2019;s apartment shaking with terror. He said he&#x2019;d had enough of Greg and was moving out of their apartment.&#x201c;Greg had pulled a gun on him,&#x201d; remembered Hill. &#x201c;Jeff wanted to get away from him and I don&#x2019;t blame him.&#x201d;Although Jeff moved back with his mother, within a few weeks he found he couldn&#x2019;t bear to be separated from his twin brother. But as they moved into a new apartment together, Greg stepped up his reign of terror, making life even more miserable for the unfortunate Jeff.<br>&nbsp;The twins settled into a one-bedroom apartment at Tree Terrace in Maxham Road, Lithia Springs, and started drinking themselves into oblivion. Greg set up his drum kit in the front room and played along to his favorite rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; roll albums into the early hours. He picked constant fights with Jeff, firing his gun indiscriminately at the least provocation.In early 1989, Ma Henry, then seventy, decided to step in and try to get her twin sons&#x2019; lives back on track. She was particularly concerned about Greg&#x2019;s drinking and the danger he posed to Jeff.The twins had recently been arrested for driving under the influence and feared losing their licenses and not being able to drive their jointly owned Camaro sports car. So under pressure from Ma Henry they agreed to go on the wagon and give up alcohol.The effects were immediate and they calmed down and began to get along with each other for the first time in many years. Turning over a new leaf, they both found jobs as audio repairmen at the Circuit City electronics store in nearby Austell, Georgia.At first the twins impressed their boss with their enthusiasm and punctuality. They would spend hours in the back room, tinkering around with the broken amplifiers and televisions, as a nonstop talk radio station played in the background. It was piece-work, and Jeff and Greg took so long on repairs that they did not make much money.&#x201c;They&#x2019;d test it and test it,&#x201d; remembers their Circuit City co-worker Ted Crowder. &#x201c;They&#x2019;d help you for two hours and speak to you, while neglecting their own work.&#x201d;A few months into the job the brothers started drinking again. While on the wagon Greg had become addicted to coffee for the caffeine buzz. He drank so many cups a day that he became sick. When a doctor friend suggested an occasional beer instead, saying it would be harmless, Greg leapt at the chance. Soon he was back to beer, drinking more heavily than ever, with Jeff following in his wake.As the twins fell back into their drunken ways, their fellow workers noticed Jeff becoming more and more paranoid and withdrawn. He bit his fingernails to the quick and was always scared that he was in trouble.&#x201c;Jeff had become like a Chihuahua,&#x201d; says Crowder. &#x201c;He was real nervous.&#x201d;At home the twins&#x2019; relationship had deteriorated even further. The domineering Greg mentally tortured Jeff as they drank their way through cases of Budweiser every night. When Ma Henry visited her sons&#x2019; apartment, she was horrified to see the stacks of empty beer containers piled up in rows against the wall.&#x201c;I knew they had a problem,&#x201d; she would later tell police. &#x201c;[I] just didn&#x2019;t seem to be able to convince them that they did.&#x201d;Things got so bad that Ma begged them to take the twelve-step program at Alcoholics Anonymous, but they refused, claiming that they were fine.&#x201c;I had discussed it with friends of mine that were friends of A.A.,&#x201d; said Ma Henry. &#x201c;I was told that sometimes people had to get really violent before they recognized there was a problem. They had performed so well as children and had such a good reputation in their profession, that I couldn&#x2019;t convince them that they [needed help].&#x201d;Jeff began to confide in his mother about Greg&#x2019;s violent temper tantrums. He said he was frightened when his brother turned on him and began blasting off the shotgun that he kept by his bed.When Ma challenged Greg, he admitted shooting at his twin once during a heated argument. But he apologized, saying that he had learned his lesson and would never do it again.&#x201c;Jeff was scared to death of Greg,&#x201d; said their mother. &#x201c;He couldn&#x2019;t go to the bathroom without asking Greg&#x2019;s permission.&#x201d;Since Greg&#x2019;s divorce almost fifteen years earlier, the twins had not dated, preferring their own company. But when a persistent young woman began pursuing Greg romantically, he told her that he was not interested. When she refused to take no for an answer he pulled out his shotgun and fired over her head, and she fled the apartment in fear for her life.<br>&nbsp;One Christmas in the late 1980s, Ma Henry organized a family reunion at her luxurious new home in Roswell, Georgia. After a full turkey dinner with all the trimmings, the twins and their brothers staged an impromptu musical jam while Ma washed the dishes.Remembered Ma Henry: &#x201c;Mike was there with his guitar and Greg had his guns [by his drum kit]. I was putting up with it because it was Christmas, but at two in the morning Jeff and Mike were ready to go to bed. And we went out to try and get Greg to go...</p><h2>As Our Years Increase: Loving, Caring, Preparing : A Guide</h2><p>Tells how to regain a positive attitude towards old age, and discusses the practical and spiritual aspects of aging</p><p></p><h2>Journeys of a Lifetime: 500 of the World&#39;s Greatest Trips</h2><p>This lavish volume reveals National Geographic's top picks for the world's most fabulous journeys, along with practical tips for your own travels.

But this one was different because, as one influential senator put it, it was "an idea whose time has come."</p><p>In a powerful narrative layered with revealing detail, Todd S.

From the Kennedy brothers to Lyndon Johnson, from Martin Luther King Jr. to Hubert Humphrey and Everett Dirksen, Purdum shows how these all-too-human figures managed, in just over a year, to create a bill that prompted the longest filibuster in the history of the U.S. Senate yet was ultimately adopted with overwhelming bipartisan support. He evokes the high purpose and low dealings that marked the creation of this monumental law, drawing on extensive archival research and dozens of new interviews that bring to life this signal achievement in American history.</p><p>Often hailed as the most important law of the past century, the Civil Rights Act stands as a lesson for our own troubled times about what is possible when patience, bipartisanship, and decency rule the day.</p></p><p><p><b>Todd S.

Edward M. Kennedy, thirty-one years old, had been the junior senator from Massachusetts for barely a year and had yet to make a speech from the floor. Suddenly, Richard Riedel, a Senate press liaison who had first come to the Capitol a half century earlier as a nine-year-old page, came running onto the Senate floor, in a breach of all decorum. He rushed for the rostrum and told the presiding officer, &#x201c;The most horrible thing has happened! It&#x2019;s terrible, terrible!&#x201d;</p> <p>Kennedy, who had been signing letters and autographing photographs, paused to ask, &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Your brother,&#x201d; Riedel began, before remembering that the senator had two brothers. &#x201c;Your brother the president. He&#x2019;s been shot.&#x201d; Riedel had seen the news on the Associated Press ticker in the Senators&#x2019; Lobby, the long corridor behind the chamber, and immediately began spreading the news. Kennedy leaped up and ran toward his own office, followed by David Schoumacher, a young CBS News reporter who had started work that very week. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anything,&#x201d; Kennedy told him. &#x201c;I just heard.&#x201d;</p> <p>A few blocks down Massachusetts Avenue, at the Chilean embassy, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, who had lost the 1960 Democratic nomination to John F. Kennedy after hard-fought primaries in Wisconsin and West Virginia, was sitting down with his wife, Muriel, at a luncheon in honor of the ambassador of Australia. The other guests included Ralph Dungan, a special assistant to President Kennedy, and Edward P. Morgan, a veteran broadcast reporter working for ABC News. An urgent telephone call summoned Morgan away from the table with the same bulletin from Dallas. He returned and told Humphrey, and together they called Dungan into a space outside the dining room. After what seemed an interminable delay, Dungan confirmed the news with the Secret Service and left for the White House. Humphrey remained, heading to his car parked in front of the embassy to listen for updates on the radio.</p> <p>Across the Potomac River in McLean, Virginia, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who two days earlier had turned thirty-eight years old, was at home taking a break from a daylong conference on organized crime. He was having lunch with his friend Robert Morgenthau, the United States attorney in Manhattan, eating a tuna fish sandwich, when the telephone rang by his backyard pool. At the other end of the line was the formidable director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover, already in his fortieth year as head of the nation&#x2019;s most powerful law enforcement agency. His voice was cold, his manner curt. &#x201c;I have news for you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The president&#x2019;s been shot.&#x201d;</p> <p>The attorney general struggled to understand. &#x201c;What? Oh&#x2014;I&#x2014;is it serious?&#x201d; he stammered.</p> <p>&#x201c;I think it is serious,&#x201d; Hoover replied. &#x201c;I am endeavoring to get details. I&#x2019;ll call you back when I find out more.&#x201d;</p> <p>In Atlanta, Martin Luther King Jr., the thirty-four-year-old preacher who for nearly a decade had been leading his nonviolent campaign for civil rights in cities across the South, was under the weather and watching television at home in bed. He had special reason to be grateful to President Kennedy, whose intercession and dramatic phone call to his wife, Coretta, during the 1960 campaign had helped secure King&#x2019;s release from jail after he was arrested at a lunch counter sit-in at an Atlanta department store and sentenced to hard labor. Now, King called out to his wife, who was on the phone downstairs, &#x201c;Corrie, I just heard that Kennedy has been shot, maybe killed.&#x201d; And then he told her, &#x201c;Oh, I hope that he will live, this is just terrible. I think that if he lives, if he pulls through this, it will help him to understand better what we go through.&#x201d;</p>&#x273b; &#x273b; &#x273b; <p></p> <p>As the minutes ticked by toward 2:00 p.m. Washington time, and then 2:30, Ted Kennedy raced on foot through the streets of his Georgetown neighborhood with his aide Milt Gwirtzman, trying in vain to find a working phone. A mass of sudden midday calls to share the news from Texas had overwhelmed the Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Company&#x2019;s entire system.</p> <p>At 2:35, United Press International moved its definitive flash from Dallas: PRESIDENT KENNEDY DEAD. In McLean, Bob Kennedy heard the news in a phone call from Taz Shepard, the president&#x2019;s naval aide, and then in another abrupt call from Director Hoover, who simply said, &#x201c;The president&#x2019;s dead,&#x201d; and hung up. (Robert Kennedy would later say that Hoover had seemed &#x201c;not quite as excited as if he were reporting the fact that he had found a Communist on the faculty of Howard University.&#x201d;)</p> <p>At the Chilean embassy, Hubert Humphrey received confirmation from Ralph Dungan at the White House and announced the news to the luncheon guests. Then he broke down in tears. Unsure of what else to do, he headed to the Northwest Gate of the White House and into Dungan&#x2019;s office in the West Wing, where a group including a young assistant secretary of labor named Daniel Patrick Moynihan had gathered. &#x201c;What have they done to us?&#x201d; Humphrey cried out. Later he would recall, &#x201c;For most of us who gathered there, there was nothing, really, to do. The fact of his death was so overwhelming; yet in this house where he worked, ate, slept, played with his kids, it was impossible to think of him in the past tense. The reality was so horrendous that the whole atmosphere, paradoxically, took on an unreal quality.&#x201d;</p> <p>In the Senate, it was the Republican minority leader, Everett McKinley Dirksen, a sixty-seven-year-old small-town boy from Pekin, Illinois, who had to make a motion for adjournment because the Democratic majority leader, Mike Mansfield of Montana, was too overcome. The scene was so chaotic that the journal of official proceedings does not even mention the reason for the break. Dirksen, who had once practiced before his family&#x2019;s cows the florid oratory that would make him known as &#x201c;the Wizard of Ooze,&#x201d; had engaged President Kennedy, his former Senate colleague, with affectionate badinage, and just that fall he had helped the president gain the Senate&#x2019;s assent to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Now he was a visage of melancholy, his jowly face contorted and gray with grief. He told reporters, &#x201c;Only someone suffering from aberrations of personality and motivated by insane passion would be guilty of the assassination of the great leader of the greatest country on earth.&#x201d;</p> <p>In the Senators&#x2019; Lobby, with its big leather chairs and racks of out-of-town newspapers, a knot of members clustered around the Associated Press wire ticker. In the center was sixty-six-year-old Richard Brevard Russell Jr. of Georgia, a stern bachelor who was the master of the chamber&#x2019;s rules, the mentor to younger Democrats, the leader of the conservative southern caucus&#x2014;and no great booster of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. As the bulletins came in from Dallas, Russell read them aloud, and his voice began to waver with each new bit of bad news, until finally the tears ran down his face.</p> <p>The crusty House Republican leader, Charles A. Halleck of Indiana, a self-described &#x201c;gut-fighter&#x201d; who only the day before had excoriated the president&#x2019;s legislative record, now insisted: &#x201c;The world should know that in this hour of national tragedy Americans stand together as one&#x2014;shocked and grieved at this incredible news. Political differences had no part in the personal affection I felt for President Kennedy&#x2014;an affection I have reason to believe the president felt for me.&#x201d;</p> <p>In Atlanta, Martin King told his wife, &#x201c;This is what&#x2019;s going to happen to me. This is such a sick society.&#x201d;</p> <p>King was especially crushed, because he felt that John Kennedy was finally coming around on civil rights. The previous June, on the same night that Governor George C. Wallace had sought unsuccessfully to block the integration of the University of Alabama, Kennedy had made a nationally televised speech, at last pledging his administration&#x2019;s support for the kind of comprehensive civil rights bill that King and others had been demanding for years. Three months later, after the murder of four little girls in a bombing at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, King thought that Kennedy had showed renewed resolve to see the bill enacted.</p> <p>The next month, on October 29, the civil rights bill, H.R. 7152, passed the House Judiciary Committee, with crucial help from its ranking Republican member, Representative William M. McCulloch of Ohio, who called Kennedy&#x2019;s assassination &#x201c;a tragic death, especially for one so young, who had so much to do and, for the doing, he had so little time.&#x201d;</p> <p>But on this November afternoon, the bill lay bottled up in the House Rules Committee, whose chairman, eighty-year-old Representative Howard W. Smith of Virginia, an ardent segregationist, had announced his intention to keep it there indefinitely. Now, King thought, the world would never get to see what history might have had in store had Kennedy lived.</p> <p>Clarence Mitchell, the chief Washington lobbyist for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the nation&#x2019;s oldest and largest civil rights group, had been working tirelessly on behalf of H.R. 7152, and his organization issued a statement saying that President Kennedy&#x2019;s &#x201c;consistent commitment to and espousal of basic human rights for all earned the undying enmity of frantic and loathsome bigots,&#x201d; and adding, &#x201c;We have no doubt that the assassin was motivated by a hatred of the president&#x2019;s ideals.&#x201d;</p> <p>That night, when Jacqueline Kennedy had returned from Texas and was grieving at Bethesda Naval Hospital as doctors conducted an autopsy on her murdered husband, she also thought of civil rights, but she was brought up short when Bob Kennedy explained that the president&#x2019;s presumed assassin was a pro-Cuban Communist sympathizer, not a right-winger. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t even have the satisfaction of being killed for civil rights,&#x201d; the First Lady told her mother, Janet Auchincloss. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s&#x2014;it had to be some silly little Communist.&#x201d;</p> <p>But Martin King and Jackie Kennedy weren&#x2019;t counting on another figure in that day&#x2019;s drama, another man in the motorcade in Dallas, who had just become the nation&#x2019;s thirty-sixth president: Lyndon Baines Johnson of Texas. Together with the crucial, indispensable support of King, Mitchell, Bob Kennedy, Humphrey, Halleck, McCulloch, and Dirksen&#x2014;and over the relentless opposition of Russell&#x2014;Johnson was about to make some history of his own. And the civil rights bill would be at its very heart.</p> <p>This is the story of the legislative and political battle to pass that bill. As such, it is largely the story of the words and actions of white men, who, with rare exceptions in 1963 and 1964, possessed the sole official agency to enact&#x2014;or block&#x2014;any such law, at a time when just five of the 535 members of Congress were black. The American civil rights movement was a massive grassroots effort, involving tens of thousands of black and white citizens, whose labors over many decades had aroused the nation&#x2019;s conscience and spurred demands for legal change that made the Civil Rights Act of 1964 possible. But paradoxically, the bill itself was proposed and passed mostly by men whose personal acquaintance with black Americans was limited to their own domestic servants and the leaders of the movement who had provided the moral impetus and historical argument for its fierce necessity. Its passage was, in that sense, all the more remarkable.</p>&#x273b; &#x273b; &#x273b; <p></p> <p>Two days after Kennedy&#x2019;s funeral, President Johnson addressed a joint session of Congress in the Capitol that had been his professional home for thirty-two years. &#x201c;All I have I would have given gladly not to be standing here today,&#x201d; he told his former colleagues and the noontime national television audience tuning in for its first extended look at the new president. &#x201c;The greatest leader of our time has been struck down by the foulest deed of our time.&#x201d; He invoked the passage in the martyred president&#x2019;s inaugural address in which Kennedy had acknowledged that his agenda would not be finished &#x201c;in the first thousand days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet,&#x201d; but had nevertheless insisted, &#x201c;Let us begin.&#x201d; Johnson now said, &#x201c;Let us continue.&#x201d;</p> <p>The new president went on to add, &#x201c;No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy&#x2019;s memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long. We have talked long enough in this country about equal rights. We have talked for a hundred years or more. It is time now to write the next chapter, and to write it in the books of law.&#x201d;</p> <p>Johnson was a most unlikely tribune for the cause he now espoused. A southerner born just eight years into the twentieth century, he still talked in private about &#x201c;Nigras,&#x201d; in terms that would not have pleased Martin Luther King or the NAACP, or the editorial board of the <i>New York Times</i>, for that matter. As Senate majority leader, he had helped pass the first serious civil rights legislation of modern times in 1957, but to gain its passage he had arranged for it to be so watered down as to make it all but unenforceable in actual practice across the South. For Johnson&#x2019;s whole time in the Senate, Richard Russell had been his particular teacher and cherished friend, and Russell was perhaps the Senate&#x2019;s single most influential supporter of segregation and its most skilled opponent of civil rights legislation.</p> <p>But in fact, Johnson&#x2019;s views on civil rights had been evolving for years. Now they had hardened into certitude that the time had come for change. Within days of the assassination, he was telling friends, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be the president who finishes what Lincoln began.&#x201d; And he summoned Russell to the White House for a blunt talking-to. &#x201c;Dick,&#x201d; Johnson said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ve got to get out of my way. I&#x2019;m going to run over you. I don&#x2019;t intend to cavil or compromise.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, Mr. President, you may well do that,&#x201d; Russell replied. &#x201c;But if you do, you&#x2019;ll not only lose this election, you will lose the South forever.&#x201d;</p> <p>Johnson did not disagree with Russell&#x2019;s political analysis. He also knew that because of Russell&#x2019;s stance, passing a civil rights bill would depend on strong Republican support, support that was far from assured. But he thought that the passage of comprehensive civil rights legislation was vital precisely because it might act as a balm for the climate of hate and extremism that was then being widely blamed for the Kennedy assassination&#x2014;and because it was a key to establishing his own credibility to pursue his other ambitious goals. He could not know that the assassination marked just the latest twist in a period of civic unrest and political tumult unrivaled since the Civil War itself. Or that some aspects of the proposed civil rights bill would still be debated in national politics nearly fifty years into the future. Or that a child in Hawaii named Barack Hussein Obama, who was two years, three months, and eighteen days old on November 22, would one day be president of the United States.</p> <p>Johnson could not even know that over the next seven months, H.R. 7152&#x2014;&#x201c;An act to enforce the constitutional right to vote, to confer jurisdiction upon the district courts of the United States of America to provide relief against discrimination in public accommodations, to authorize the Attorney General to institute suits to protect constitutional rights in public facilities and public education,&#x201d; among other things&#x2014;would consume the country. He could not know that it would prompt...</p></p><h2>MAR, Vol. 5 (Mar (Graphic Novels))</h2><p>Ginta is a near-sighted junior high school boy who has a reoccurring dream where he is a hero in a fantasy world, and one day a supernatural figure summons him to his dream world.</p><p>Nobuyuki Anzai&#39;s Flame of Recca first appeared in 1995 in the prestigious Japanese magazine Shonen Sunday.

She lives in London.</p>I <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>1. <br>Nearly ten years ago, in that sweltering summer, that heat wave summer, when to walk just half a mile meant a sticky sheen of sweat, I developed a phobia of moths. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I had never liked them, my nervousness shaped no doubt by my mother&#x2019;s fear of the things. Her brother used to breed huge African specimens in their East Anglia home; they would fly up at her, startled, out of her shoes, her bedclothes. And then there was a teenage summer spent in a Gothic pile in France, where hordes of angry bees rattled behind the chimney, and disconcerting noises-off unsettled the most rational of family and guests. Fat armies of sated flies and flotillas of dark, wide moths appeared every night in a bedroom in which my sister eventually refused to sleep. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>When the stay was over&#x2014;but only then&#x2014;we speculated giddily about dead bodies under floorboards. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>So far, so manageable. But when that heat wave brought fatter, more alien moths to a tiny university town where I was deeply in love, and caught in the headlights of a Ph.D., dislike burgeoned into something else: an all-consuming terror whenever one would flap and flutter into view. Its blurry agitation would have me darting across a room before I knew what I was doing. Once, I leapt out of a shower in panic as one frantically ricocheted around the folds of a curtain. Out like a shot, I stood dripping shampoo on the hall carpet. The worst prospect: a moth sticking itself to my wet skin. It might disintegrate. A wing would be detached from a body; several different bits of moth might be stuck to me. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Dead, dismembered moth. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I went to a friend&#x2019;s next door to rinse my hair. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>There was a phase of nervously checking, at arm&#x2019;s length, the curtains in my bedroom before sleep, poised to sprint from the scene should one rise from the lurid floral pattern. The pleasure of open windows on summer evenings was fraught with danger: those awful things, drawn to the light. Static, embracing a wall, they were almost worse, for they would inevitably move, taking disorganized, fitful flight. And when they were immobile one could see, if one dared look, their dreadful texture, their vile components. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I dreamt, once, of one pinning me down on the stone slabs of a suburban garden. It settled softly on me, trapping me under its insect blanket. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The wings&#x2014;warm and dark, flimsy but strong. The furry texture of the body. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Those fucking moths. <br> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2012 by Katherine Angel <br></p><h2>Bulfinch&#39;s Mythology</h2><p>For almost a century and a half, Bulfinch's Mythology has been the text by which the great tales of the gods and goddesses, Greek and Roman antiquity; Scandinavian, Celtic, and Oriental fables and myths; and the age of chivalry have been known. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stories are divided into three sections: The Age of Fable or Stories of Gods and Heroes (first published in 1855); The Age of Chivalry (1858), which contains King Arthur and His Knights, The Mabinogeon, and The Knights of English History; and Legends of Charlemagne or Romance of the Middle Ages (1863). For the Greek myths, Bulfinch drew on Ovid and Virgil, and for the sagas of the north, from Mallet's Northern Antiquities. He provides lively versions of the myths of Zeus and Hera, Venus and Adonis, Daphne and Apollo, and their cohorts on Mount Olympus; the love story of Pygmalion and Galatea; the legends of the Trojan War and the epic wanderings of Ulysses and Aeneas; the joys of Valhalla and the furies of Thor; and the tales of Beowulf and Robin Hood. <br>The tales are eminently readable. As Bulfinch wrote, "Without a knowledge of mythology much of the elegant literature of our own language cannot be understood and appreciated. . . . Our book is an attempt to solve this problem, by telling the stories of mythology in such a manner as to make them a source of amusement."<br><br>Thomas Bulfinch, in his day job, was a clerk in the Merchant's Bank of Boston, an undemanding position that afforded him ample leisure time in which to pursue his other interests. In addition to serving as secretary of the Boston Society of Natural History, he thoroughly researched the myths and legends and copiously cross-referenced them with literature and art. As such, the myths are an indispensable guide to the cultural values of the nineteenth century; however, it is the vigor of the stories themselves that returns generation after generation to Bulfinch.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

This is the choice St. Augustine offered 1500 years ago--and according to Pierre Manent the modern West has decisively and irreversibly chosen the latter. In this subtle and wide-ranging book on the Western intellectual and political condition, Manent argues that the West has rejected the laws of God and of nature in a quest for human autonomy. But in declaring ourselves free and autonomous, he contends, we have, paradoxically, lost a sense of what it means to be human.</p><br><p> In the first part of the book, Manent explores the development of the social sciences since the seventeenth century, portraying their growth as a sign of increasing human "self-consciousness." But as social scientists have sought to free us from the intellectual confines of the ancient world, he writes, they have embraced modes of analysis--economic, sociological, and historical--that treat only narrow aspects of the human condition and portray individuals as helpless victims of impersonal forces. As a result, we have lost all sense of human agency and of the unified human subject at the center of intellectual study. Politics and culture have come to be seen as mere foam on the tides of historical and social necessity.</p><br><p> In the second half of the book, titled "Self-Affirmation," Manent examines how the West, having discovered freedom, then discovered arbitrary will and its dangers. With no shared touchstones or conceptions of virtue, for example, we have found it increasingly hard to communicate with each other. This is a striking contrast to the past, he writes, when even traditions as different as the Classical and the Christian held many of these conceptions in common.</p><br><p> The result of these discoveries, according to Manent, is the disturbing rootlessness that characterizes our time. By gaining autonomy from external authority, we have lost a sense of what we are. In "giving birth" to ourselves, we have abandoned that which alone can nurture and sustain us. With penetrating insight and remarkable erudition, Manent offers a profound analysis of the confusions and contradictions at the heart of the modern condition.</p></p><p><p>"More than simply an intellectual history of liberalism. . .[this is also] a powerful and impassioned analysis of modernity. . . .

Despite the label "teams," top leaders tend to avoid teaming and the real progress is made behind closed doors, not at the team meetings. After writing <i>The Wisdom of Teams</i>, Katzenbach discovered there are special dynamics that characterize leadership groups at the top. Many times so-called teams are really working groups with a single leader--and often, these non-team groups at the top work pretty well. He explains that the solution doesn't lie in mandating teams or in changing top leaders' styles, or even in designing a better top team structure; rather, the key is in clearly differentiating between team and non-team opportunities and developing the capability to shift into different leadership modes, different leadership roles, and appropriate team membership composition depending upon the desired results. High-performing organizations require a balanced leadership effort that fully exploits non-team as well as team approaches.</p></p><p>Rigorously objective and relentlessly realistic, Teams at the Top performs the greatest service a management book can render by deliberately avoiding simplistic, trendy prescriptions in favor of something much more enduring and substantial: understanding and insight. --Jim Collins, Co-author of Built to Last <p>Katzenbach has earned the reputation as the leading thinker on teams in organized enterprises, and this book will enhance that stature.

They succeeded to the point where all the GOP candidates for president in 2008 scurried to claim his mantle, no matter how preposterous the fit.<p>With clear eyes and an ever-present wit, Bunch reveals the truth about the Ronald Reagan legacy, including the following:</p><blockquote><p></p><li>Despite the idolatry of the last fifteen years, Reagan's average popularity as president was only, well, average, lower than that of a half-dozen modern presidents. More important, while he was in office, a majority of Americans opposed most of his policies and by 1988 felt strongly that the nation was on the wrong track. Reagan's 1981 tax cut, weighted heavily toward the rich, did not cause the economic recovery of the 1980s. It was fueled instead by dropping oil prices, the normal business cycle, and the tight fiscal policies of the chairman of the Federal Reserve appointed by Jimmy Carter. Reagan's tax cut did, however, help usher in the deregulated modern era of CEO and Wall Street greed.</li><p></p><li>Most historians agree that Reagan's waste-ridden military buildup didn't actually "win the Cold War." And Reagan mythmakers ignore his real contributions -- his willingness to talk to his Soviet adversaries, his genuine desire to eliminate nuclear weapons, and the surprising role of a "liberal" Hollywood-produced TV movie.</li><p></p><li>George H. W. Bush's and Bill Clinton's rolling back of Reaganomics during the 1990s spurred a decade of peace and prosperity as well as the reactionary campaign to pump up the myth of Ronald Reagan and restore right-wing hegemony over Washington. This effort has led to war, bankrupt energy policies, and coming generations of debt.</li></blockquote><p>With masterful insight, Bunch exposes this dangerous effort to reshape America's future by rewriting its past. As the Obama administration charts its course, he argues, it should do so unencumbered by the dead weight of misplaced and unearned reverence.</p></p><p>Will Bunch, currently a senior writer for the <i>Philadelphia Daily News</i> and the author of a popular political blog called "Attytood," which has a progressive bent and a national readership, has been covering presidential races since Reagan&#x2019;s re-election in 1984. He has won numerous journalism awards, sharing the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for spot news reporting with the <i>New York Newsday</i> staff. He is author of one previous book, and his writings have appeared in the <i>New York Times Magazine, American Prospect, Mother Jones</i> and elsewhere.<p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p><b>Ronald Reagan Boulevard</b></p><blockquote><p><i>"Who controls the past" ran the Party slogan, "controls the future: who controls the present controls the past."<br></i> -- George Orwell, 1984</p></blockquote><p>The present was January 30, 2008, when four powerful men walked onto a freshly built debate stage in Simi Valley, California, seeking to control the past -- most ironically, the American past that was at its peak in that very "Morning in America" year of 1984. They knew that whoever controlled the past on this night would have a real shot at controlling the future of the United States of America.</p><p>Lest there be any doubt of that, the large block letters UNITED STATES OF AMERICA hovered for ninety minutes over the heads of these men -- the last four Republican candidates for president in 2008 -- who had made the pilgrimage to the cavernous main hall inside Simi Valley's Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. This was the final debate of a primary campaign that had basically started in this very room nine months ago and now was about to essentially end here -- in what was becoming a kind of National Cathedral to Ronald Reagan, even complete with his burial vault. The block letters were stenciled across the hulking blue and white frame of a modified Boeing 707 jetliner that officially carried the bland bureaucratic title of SAM (Special Air Mission) 27000, but bore the title of Air Force One from 1972 through 1990 -- a remarkable era of highs and lows for the American presidency.</p><p>To many baby boomers, this jet's place in history was burnished on August 9, 1974, when it carried the disgraced Richard Nixon home to California on his first day as a private citizen. But that was before SAM 27000 was passed down to Ronald Reagan and now to the Ronald Reagan legacy factory, which flew it back here to the Golden State, power-washed it clean, and reassembled it as the visual centerpiece of Reagan's presidential library. It was now part American aviation icon and part political reliquary, suspended all deus ex machina from the roof in its new final resting place, with Reagan's notepads and even his beloved jelly beans as its holy artifacts.</p><p>And for much of this winter night, the men seeking to become GOP nominee -- and hopefully win the presidency, as the Republican candidate had done in seven out of the ten previous presidential elections -- looked and felt like tiny profiles on a sprawling American tarmac under the shadow of the jetliner, and of Reagan himself. Fittingly, each chose his words carefully, as if he were running not to replace the hugely unpopular George W. Bush in the Oval Office -- at an inauguration 356 days hence -- but to become the spiritual heir to 1980s icon Reagan himself, as if the winner would be whisked up a boarding staircase and into the cabin of SAM 27000 at the end of the night and be flown from here to a conservative eternity.</p><p>As was so often the case, news people were equal co-conspirators with the politicians in creating a political allegory around Reagan. The debate producer was CNN's David Bohrman, who'd once staged a TV show atop Mount Everest and now said the Air Force One backdrop was "my crazy idea" and that he had lobbied officials at the library to make it happen. He told the local <i>Ventura County Star</i> that the candidates were "here to get the keys to that plane."</p><p>By picking Reagan's Air Force One and the artifacts of his life as props for a Republican presidential debate that would be watched by an estimated 4 million Americans, CNN shunned what would have been a more obvious motif: the news of 2008. If you had been watching CNN or MSNBC or Fox or the other ever-throbbing arteries of America's 24-hour news world, or sat tethered to the ever-bouncing electrons of political cyberspace in the hours leading up to the debate, you'd have seen a vivid snapshot of a world superpower seeking a new leader in the throes of overlapping crises -- economic, military, and in overall U.S. confidence.</p><p>On this Wednesday in January, the drumbeat of bad news from America's nearly five-year-old war in Iraq -- fairly muted for a few weeks -- resumed loudly as five American towns learned they had lost young men to a roadside bomb during heavy fighting two days earlier. Most citizens were by now so numb to such grim Iraq reports that the casualties barely made the national news. The same was true of a heated exchange at a Senate hearing involving new attorney general Michael Mukasey. He was trying to defend U.S. tactics for interrogation of terrorism suspects, tactics that most of the world had come to regard as torture -- seriously harming America's moral standing in the world. Meanwhile, it was a particularly bad day for the American mortgage industry, which had a major presence in Simi Valley through a large back office for troubled lender Countrywide Financial. That afternoon, the Wall Street rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's threatened to downgrade a whopping $500 billion of investments tied to bad home loans, while the largest bank in Europe, UBS AG, posted a quarterly loss of $14 billion because of its exposure to U.S. subprime mortgages. Such loans had fueled an exurban housing bubble in once-desolate places like the brown hillsides on the fringe of Ventura County around Simi Valley, and had been packaged and sold as high-risk securities.</p><p>That same day, nearly three thousand miles to the east, Jim Cramer -- the popular, wild-eyed TV stock guru, and hardly a flaming liberal -- was giving a speech at Bucknell University in which he traced the roots of the current mortgage crisis all the way back to the pro-business policies initiated nearly three decades earlier by America's still popular -- even beloved by some -- fortieth president, the late Ronald Wilson Reagan. "Ever since the Reagan era," Cramer told the students, "our nation has been regressing and repealing years and years' worth of safety net and equal economic justice in the name of discrediting and dismantling the federal government's missions to help solve our nation's collective domestic woes."</p><p>But there would be no questions about economic justice or the shrinking safety net at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, the epicenter of America's political universe, what with California's presidential primary -- the crown jewel of the delegate bonanza known as Super Tuesday -- less than a week away. The GOP's Final Four evoked the parable about the blind man. Each seemed to represent a different appendage of the Republican elephant -- the slicked-back businessman-turned-pol Mitt Romney, the good-humored former Baptist minister Mike Huckabee, the fiery fringe libertarian Ron Paul, and Vietnam War hero and POW John McCain, a self-described "straight talker" on a meandering political odyssey. Despite their unique and compelling stories and their considerable differences -- both in background and in appeal to rival GOP voting blocs -- each was apparently determined to stake out the same contrived identity. It was like an old black-and-white rerun of <i>To Tell the Truth</i> with four contestants all declaring: "My name is Ronald Reagan."</p><p>CNN's moderator, Anderson Cooper, followed a script for the night that was clearly inspired by this massive effort -- including the construction of a special floor underneath the plane -- to make Reagan's Air Force One and thus the spirit of Reagan himself the stars of this slick TV production in the guise of a debate. The opening shot featured widow Nancy Reagan, eighty-six years old then, in a trademark red dress, greeting Cooper and then welcoming the candidates to Simi Valley. Cooper talked up the Boeing 707 -- the "stirring backdrop for our debate tonight" -- and a camera toured the cabin, ending up at the jelly bean tray.</p><p>The whole ninety minutes was drenched in Reagan idolatry. It peaked later when Cooper asked the candidates about abortion and quoted from an entry in Reagan's diary about the 1981 appointment of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court. "And the Reagan Library has graciously allowed us to actually have the original Reagan diary right here on the desk," he said. "I'm a little too nervous to actually even touch it, but that is Ronald Reagan's original diary."</p><p>It was this kind of 1980s hero worship that carried the debate and framed the discussion, rather than frank talk about the grim headlines of war and economic uncertainty that dominated the world of the present. It almost didn't even seem bizarre that Cooper worked into the abortion issue by asking not about their stances in 2008 but about what they thought of Reagan's nomination of the abortion-rights-friendly O'Connor some twenty-seven years earlier. The CNN host reminded the candidates of Reagan's so�??called eleventh commandment against speaking ill of fellow Republicans -- adding gratuitously that "no one was tougher and more formidable in debates than Ronald Reagan" -- and Cooper's first question was an update of Reagan's famous 1980 debate line "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?"</p><p>The candidates were asked several different ways whether they were conservative enough, or about the state of the modern Republican Party, matters that would be of little concern to the average voter. Meanwhile, the list of things that Cooper didn't ask them about that night is mindboggling: the high cost of gasoline, and energy policy. Health care. The increasingly powerful role that China, India, and other emerging countries are playing on the world stage. Iran, Afghanistan, or Israel. America's image in the world in the face of outrage over torture and the detentions at Guantanamo Bay.</p><p>None of the candidates even seemed to notice what was left out, since they were too busy trying to hit the Reagan stage marks laid out in front of them. McCain, under conservative fire for opposing a GOP-backed tax cut in 2001, insisted he did so because it violated Reagan's principles by not cutting government spending enough. "I was part of the Reagan revolution," boasted McCain. "I was there with Jack Kemp and Phil Gramm and Warren Rudman and all these other fighters that want...</p></p><h2>Longbourn</h2><p><p>A brilliantly imagined, irresistible below-stairs answer to <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>: a story of the romance, intrigue and drama among the servants of the Bennet household, a triumphant tale of defying society's expectations, and an illuminating glimpse of working-class lives in Regency England. <br><br>The servants at Longbourn estate--only glancingly mentioned in Jane Austen's classic--take centre stage in Jo Baker's lively, cunning new novel. Here are the Bennets as we have never known them: seen through the eyes of those scrubbing the floors, cooking the meals, emptying the chamber pots. Our heroine is Sarah, an orphaned housemaid beginning to chafe against the boundaries of her class. When the militia marches into town, a new footman arrives under mysterious circumstances, and Sarah finds herself the object of the attentions of an ambitious young former slave working at neighboring Netherfield Hall, the carefully choreographed world downstairs at Longbourn threatens to be completely, perhaps irrevocably, up-ended. From the stern but soft-hearted housekeeper to the starry-eyed kitchen maid, these new characters come vividly to life in this already beloved world. Jo Baker shows us what Jane Austen wouldn't in a captivating, wonderfully evocative, moving work of fiction.</p></p><p>JO BAKER was born in Lancashire and educated at Oxford University and Queen's University Belfast. She is the author of <i>The Undertow,</i> and of 3 earlier novels published in the United Kingdom: <i>Offcomer, The Mermaid's Child</i> and <i>The Telling.</i> She lives in Lancaster.Chapter II <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x2018;Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.&#x2019;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> They were lucky to get him. That was what Mr B. said, as he folded his newspaper and set it aside. What with the War in Spain, and the press of so many able fellows into the Navy; there was, simply put, a dearth of men.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>A dearth of men?</i> Lydia repeated the phrase, anxiously searching her sisters&#x2019; faces: was this indeed the case? <i>Was England running out of men?</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> Her father raised his eyes to heaven; Sarah, meanwhile, made big astonished eyes at Mrs Hill: a new servant joining the household! A <i>man</i>servant! Why hadn&#x2019;t she mentioned it before? Mrs Hill, clutching the coffee pot to her bosom, made big eyes back, and shook her head: shhh! I don&#x2019;t know, and don&#x2019;t you dare ask! So Sarah just gave half a nod, clamped her lips shut, and returned her attention to the table, proffering the platter of cold ham: all would come clear in good time, but it did not do to ask. It did not do to speak at all, unless directly addressed. It was best to be deaf as a stone to these conversations, and seem as incapable of forming an opinion on them. <br> &nbsp;<br> Miss Mary lifted the serving fork and skewered a slice of ham. &#x2018;Papadoesn&#x2019;t mean your beaux, Lydia &#x2013; do you, Papa?&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br> Mr B., leaning out of the way so that Mrs Hill could pour his coffee, said that indeed he did not mean her beaux: Lydia&#x2019;s beaux always seemed to be in more than plentiful supply. But of working men there was a genuine shortage, which is why he had settled with this lad so promptly &#x2013; this with an apologetic glance to Mrs Hill, as she moved around him and went to fill his wife&#x2019;s cup &#x2013; though the quarter day of Michaelmas was not quite yet upon them, it being the more usual occasion for the hiring and dismissal of servants.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t object to this hasty act, I take it, Mrs Hill?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Indeed I am very pleased to hear of it, sir, if he be a decent sort of fellow.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;He is, Mrs Hill; I can assure you of that.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Who is he, Papa? Is he from one of the cottages? Do we know the family?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr B. raised his cup before replying. &#x2018;He is a fine upstanding young man, of good family. I had an excellent character of him.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I, for one, am very glad that we will have a nice young man to drive us about,&#x2019; said Lydia, &#x2018;for when Mr Hill is perched up there on the carriage box it always looks like we have trained a monkey, shaved him here and there and put him in a hat.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs Hill stepped away from the table, and set the coffee pot down on the buffet.<br> &#x2018;Lydia!&#x2019; Jane and Elizabeth spoke at once.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;What? He does, you know he does. Just like a spider-monkey, like the one Mrs Long&#x2019;s sister brought with her from London.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs Hill looked down at a willow-pattern dish, empty, though crusted round with egg. The three tiny people still crossed their tiny bridge, and the tiny boat crawled like an earwig across the china sea, and all was calm there, and unchanging, and perfect. She breathed. Miss Lydia meant no harm, she never did. And however heedlessly she expressed herself, she was right: this change was certainly to be welcomed. Mr Hill had become, quite suddenly, old. Last winter had been a worrying time: the long drives, the late nights while the ladies danced or played at cards; he had got deeply cold, and had shivered for hours by the fire on his return, his breath rattling in his chest. The coming winter&#x2019;s balls and parties might have done for him entirely. A nice young man to drive the carriage, and to take up the slack about the house; it could only be to the good.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs Bennet had heard tell, she was now telling her husband and daughters delightedly, of how in the best households they had nothing but manservants waiting on the family and guests, on account of every- one knowing that they cost more in the way of wages, and that there was a high tax to pay on them, because all the fit strong fellows were wanted for the fields and for the war. When it was known that the Bennets now had a smart young man about the place, waiting at table, opening the doors, it would be a thing of great note and marvel in the neighbourhood.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I am sure our daughters should be vastly grateful to you, for letting us appear to such advantage, Mr Bennet. You are so considerate. What, pray, is the young fellow&#x2019;s name?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;His given name is James,&#x2019; Mr Bennet said. &#x2018;The surname is a very common one. He is called Smith.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;James Smith.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was Mrs Hill who had spoken, barely above her breath, but the words were said. Jane lifted her cup and sipped; Elizabeth raised her eyebrows but stared at her plate; Mrs B. glanced round at her house- keeper. Sarah watched a flush rise up Mrs Hill&#x2019;s throat; it was all so new and strange that even Mrs Hill had forgot herself for a moment. And then Mr B. swallowed, and cleared his throat, breaking the silence.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;As I said, a common enough name. I was obliged to act with some celerity in order to secure him, which is why you were not sooner informed, Mrs Hill; I would much rather have consulted you in advance.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cheeks pink, the housekeeper bowed her head in acknowledgement.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Since the servants&#x2019; attics are occupied by your good self, your husband and the housemaids, I have told him he might sleep above the stables. Other than that, I will leave the practical and domestic details to you. He knows he is to defer to you in all things.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Thank you, sir,&#x2019; she murmured.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Well.&#x2019; Mr B. shook out his paper, and retreated behind it. &#x2018;There we are, then. I am glad that it is all settled.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; said Mrs B. &#x2018;Are you not always saying, Hill, how you need another pair of hands about the place? This will lighten your load, will it not? This will lighten all your loads.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Their mistress took in Sarah with a wave of her plump hand, and then, with a flap towards the outer reaches of the house, indicated the rest of the domestic servants: Mr Hill who was hunkered in the kitchen, riddling the fire, and Polly who was, at that moment, thumping down the back stairs with a pile of wet Turkish towels and a scowl.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;You should be very grateful to Mr Bennet for his thoughtfulness, I am sure.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Thank you, sir,&#x2019; said Sarah.<br> &nbsp;<br> The words, though softly spoken, made Mrs Hill glance across at her; the two of them caught eyes a moment.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Thank you, sir,&#x2019; said Mrs Hill.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs Bennet dabbed a further spoonful of jam on her remaining piece of buttered muffin, popped it in her mouth, and chewed it twice; she spoke around her mouthful: &#x2018;That&#x2019;ll be all, Hill.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr B. looked up from his paper at his wife, and then at his housekeeper.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Yes, thank you very much, Mrs Hill,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;That will be all for now.&#x2019;</p><h2>General Gordon Granger: The Savior of Chickamauga and the Man Behind &#34;Juneteenth&#34; (Leadership in Action)</h2><p>This is the first full-length biography of the Civil War general who saved the Union army from catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Chickamauga, and went on to play major roles in the Chattanooga and Mobile campaigns. Immediately after the war, as commander of U.S. troops in Texas, his actions sparked the &#x201c;Juneteenth&#x201d; celebrations of slavery&#x2019;s end, which continue to this day.<br><br>Granger&#x2019;s first battle was at Wilson&#x2019;s Creek, Missouri, and he soon thereafter rose through the ranks&#x2014;cavalry, then infantry&#x2014;in early 1863 vying with Forrest and Van Dorn for control of central Tennessee. The artillery platform he erected at Franklin, dubbed Fort Granger, would soon overlook the death knell of the main Confederate army in the west.<br><br>Granger&#x2019;s first fame, however, came at Chickamauga, when the Rebel Army of Tennessee came within a hair&#x2019;s-breadth of destroying the Union Army of the Cumberland. Without orders&#x2014;even defying them&#x2014;Granger marched his Reserve Corps to the scene of the hottest action, where Thomas was just barely holding on with the rump of Rosecrans&#x2019; army. Bringing fresh ammunition and hurling his men against Longstreet&#x2019;s oncoming legions, Granger provided just enough breathing space to prevent that Union defeat from becoming the worst open-field battle disgrace of the war.<br><br>Granger was then given command of a full infantry corps, but just proved too odd of a fellow to promote further. At Chattanooga he got on the nerves of U.S. Grant for going off to shoot cannons instead of commanding his troops (he&#x2019;d actually indulged this impulse also at Chickamauga) and Sherman had no use for him either. So he went down to join Farragut in the conquest of Mobile, Alabama, leading land operations against the Confederate forts.<br><br>This long-overdue biography sheds fascinating new light on a colorful commander who fought through the war in the West from its first major battles to its last, and even left his impact on the Reconstruction beyond.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Preface and Acknowledgments<br>Introduction: &#x201c;Him that holds on to the end&#x201d; <br><br>1 Early Life and West Point<br>2 Mexico and the Frontier<br>3 Civil War<br>4 General Granger<br>5 Chickamauga<br>6 Chattanooga<br>7 East Tennessee<br>8 Mobile<br>9 Juneteenth<br>10 Postwar Service in the South and West<br>11 Final Tour<br><br>Epilogue<br>Bibliography<br>Index<br></p><p>Robert Conner specializes in US history."brilliantly uses a solid array of primary sources to paint a good portrait of this complex man, whose military acumen was overshadowed often by his personal shortcomings...In this new book, we are introduced to a general whose self-assurance, boldness, and quick-thinking proved to be a major asset on the battlefield, but whose propensity to disregard cooperation with his peers kept him from army command when his martial performance rivaled men who rose to that position. ...It&#x2019;s an excellent and long overdue addition to the historiography of the Western Theater of the Civil War, as well as to the Reconstruction movement and the relations of the military with the freed slaves of the Old South and the Southwest."

Historical discrepancies, symbol variations and changed attunements suggested that the system had become somewhat like a game of Chinese whispers.

On travelling to Japan they realised that traditional Japanese Reiki communities with ancient practitioners were slowly opening their doors to Westerners and many of Reiki's unknown secrets were gradually being divulged. <p>This journey stimulated Bronwen and Frans to write a book tracing the history of the system through to the modern day.

A woman's handwriting listed guests due to arrive this week&#x2015;with abbreviated notes beside their names.</p> <p>Joe Matheson, investment broker&#x2013;sounded sexy, first arrival.</p> <p>Hugh Sutherland, thrill seeker&#x2013;rugged voice.</p> <p>Ted Greystalk, bank president&#x2013;promising.</p> <p>Caesar Silverman, dive-shop owner&#x2013;sounded wet and wild.</p> <p>Finn snorted. He didn't think she liked Navy SEAL types much because he and Hunter were SEALs. So why would the owner of a dive shop be appealing? Maybe she covertly was impressed with SEALs but refused to admit it, and the diver reminded her of a SEAL.</p> <p>Rocky Montana, independently wealthy&#x2013;mysterious.</p> <p>The guy sounded like he was a wrestler or something. But the "mysterious" bothered Finn most. A man with something to hide?</p> <p>Five other names had been crossed out and had merited comments like "not rugged enough," "sounded way too controlling," "by own admission, strictly loner wolf," "too old sounding," "strictly human," and "mated!"</p> <p>She had another list of eligible and ineligible wolves for the following week.</p> <p>Finn slapped the notebook closed and set up a hidden camera in the living room, wedging it between books in the bookcase. He would have a couple of his buddies run background checks on each of the men to see if they could turn up anything. Because lupus garous lived so long, they had to change their occupations and locations after a time to avoid suspicion, so the background checks might not turn up much.</p> <p>That was fine. Finn would interrogate the men thoroughly in person anyway. He smiled a little. He'd prove to them that none had what it took to turn Meara's head.</p> <p>Still, Finn couldn't believe Hunter had left a couple of sub-leaders in control of the pack and Meara in charge of the cabins. So who the hell was in charge of Meara?</p> <p>The worst-case scenario was that Meara would get stuck with a wolf she wasn't interested in mating due to a poor choice on her part. From what Hunter had told him, she'd always been headstrong and hard to heel, and Finn figured the years hadn't changed her. Besides, she was always picking up the wrong kind of men.</p> <p>Finn stalked down the plush ivory-carpeted hall to her bedroom&#x2015;a nicely appointed room with a queen-sized bed covered in an olive-colored silk comforter and pillows, all trimmed in gold. The walls were a marbleized olive color, and all the wood was rosewood, making him feel as if he were in a cozy woodland den. On the walls hung pictures of redwoods from the California forests Meara and Hunter had called home for more than a century. Finn wondered if Meara ever got homesick, or if she'd adjusted to living on the Oregon coast. He still couldn't believe they'd been forced to move because of some damned arsonist.</p> <p>Used to living out of a duffel bag, Finn was surprised to feel an uncharacteristic pang of longing for an ocean-view cabin, comfortable, homey, and appealing for every season. He had a place of his own with an ocean view a couple hours south, having thought he might live there if he ever wanted to set down more permanent roots, but he rarely stayed there, renting it out to others for most of the year. Or using it as a safe house on occasion.</p> <p>His home didn't feel like his own place, having been decorated by an interior decorator. Nothing there was his personally. It was just a spot to drop in when it was vacant, once in a blue moon, and he wasn't on a mission.</p> <p>Meara's cabin had a different ocean view, and it was warmer somehow, filled with her enticing scent and smaller, homier than his place. A rosewood-framed collection of pictures of her family&#x2015;Hunter, her parents, and her uncle, who had owned the cabin resort before giving it to Hunter and Meara&#x2015;sat on the dresser. A silver-plated hairbrush engraved with her grandmother's name rested beside the pictures. A tube of lip gloss next to that made Finn think of Meara's moistened lips&#x2015;succulent, full and petulant, and damned ripe for kissing. He scowled at himself for even going there and glanced out the window.</p> <p>He could imagine a summer day like today with a refreshing, cool ocean breeze blowing through the open windows, or a wintry landscape where the pines were dusted with snowflakes while he ran through them in his wolf coat, or spring wildflowers filling the woods, or the leaves turning crimson, burnt orange, and brilliant yellow on a fall day.</p> <p>He shook his head at himself. When had he become an old man?</p> <p>He stripped out of his clothes and dumped them next to his duffel bag. If any of these vacationing wolves thought they had half a chance of making a play for Meara without Hunter around, they'd soon learn that they'd have to deal with another alpha male.</p> <p>The situation could be a lot more serious than that&#x2015;not that selecting the wrong mate wasn't serious enough, since lupus garous mated for life and lived long lives. Finn didn't know if, in an effort to get to Hunter, the assassin would attempt to grab Meara.</p> <p>Finn snatched his cell phone from his belt and tried to call Hunter one last time. According to one of Hunter's sub-leaders, Chris Tarleton, Hunter would be flying out with his mate to Hawaii any minute now and he'd probably already turned off his cell phone. Hell, Finn had to warn Hunter to watch his back. If he'd only known sooner that Hunter had moved his lupus garou pack from Northern California to the Oregon coast, Finn might have caught Hunter before he left. A few months had passed since their last contracted mission, and Finn had just assumed that Hunter and his pack were still living in the same place they had for years.</p> <p>The phone rang and rang. No answer. Finn would have to keep trying to reach him. For now, Finn needed to stake the territory as his own until Hunter returned. Finn extended his arms and summoned the quick and painless transformation into his wolf form, welcoming the stretching of muscles and tissue. The softer fur covered his skin close to his body, while the coarser outer coat added a protective layer. He dropped to stand on all four paws before loping down the hall to the kitchen where a wolf door was his ticket to the outside.</p> <p>Once outside, he raced across the slate-gray patio, then dove into the woods surrounding the oceanfront cottage and ran along a trail already marked by Hunter and a female, probably his mate. By the time the two of them returned from Hawaii, their scent markings would be two weeks old, and another werewolf coming into the area might think it was unoccupied, allowing him to stake a claim to the territory.</p> <p>Finn loped through the northern pine and Douglas fir forests, scent-marking the area surrounding each of the five rental cabins. Waves crashed below the cliffs, and the Pacific Ocean breeze shook the pine branches as the clean air filled his lungs. He paused briefly at the cliffside to take another heady breath and watch the foaming waves crest and fall against the beach. He could never get enough of the sea.</p> <p>But instead of striking from the direction of the sea and returning there after accomplishing his clandestine mission, as he would have done while serving as one of the elite U.S. Navy SEALs, Finn was sticking to the land this time. Nothing about this operation would be clandestine. Finn wanted the assassin to know he was here protecting his own, if whoever it was decided to make a hit on anyone else who had been with the team.</p> <p>Hunter had been like a brother to Finn while they'd served as SEALs, and Finn owed it to Hunter to keep him safe&#x2015;and Hunter's sister also, knowing that she could be a target and Hunter wasn't here to protect her. Not that Meara would see it that way once she learned why Finn was here, he suspected.</p> <p>Finn leaped over a fallen tree on a pine-needle path farther away from the ocean, breathing in the scents of pine and fresh water trickling by in an ice-cold stream. Neither could mask the distinct smell of another predator. A cougar. And farther in the distance, its potential prey, an elk.</p> <p>Finn paused, twisting his ears this way and that, listening to the sounds of the ocean, the water in the stream, and the birds twittering and singing to one another, but he could detect no other sound of animals, human or otherwise, traversing the land.</p> <p>Despite this not being Finn's territory, he was leaving fresh markings and making it his territory until Hunter returned home. Finn scratched the ground again with his paws to help ensure that any newcomer would know Meara had not been left alone without protection.</p> <p>Finn loped back toward the house, satisfied he'd left enough of his scent to warn anyone who intended to get close to the territory to back off. He glanced at the drive in front of the wood-frame cabin. No vehicle there yet. From what Chris Tarleton had reluctantly told him, Meara should be returning from the airport in about an hour.</p> <p>Chris definitely didn't sound happy to hear that Finn was back, nor that he was looking out for Meara's welfare. Finn wondered what interest Chris had in Meara. A pack sub-leader's interest&#x2015;as in she was the leader's sister, and if she was in trouble and Chris didn't watch out for her, he would be in trouble? Or something of a more personal nature?</p> <p>Baby-sitting Meara wasn't what Finn had in mind, either. But the assassin had already attempted to kill one of their SEAL team members and was suspected of going after another. Finn had the sneaking suspicion that the assassin intended to go after each of them. Fortunately for them, the assassin was batting zero, and with the SEALs aware of the menace, whoever this was would have a devil of a time succeeding now.</p> <p>Finn ran around the pine trees surrounding the house to the back patio of Meara's cabin. He'd checked out the cabin farther down the coast and found it was Hunter's and Tessa's. Meara's sweet scent permeated this cabin. And here's where he'd stay until he could reach Hunter and apprise him of the situation.</p> <p>Butting through the wolf door with his nose, Finn entered the kitchen and headed for the master bedroom to dress. If he had judged the time right, Meara would be arriving soon. He'd have a fight on his hands from the outset. Guaranteed.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Although thrilled for her brother and his mate and their new beginning, Meara was trying not to show how excited and anxious she was to see Hunter and Tessa off quickly on their flight. Meara impatiently waved as they headed to the waiting area past the security check station, and once they were out of sight, she booked it out of there.</p> <p>Now was her chance to throw out the red carpet for the prospective bachelor alpha males who had leased the cabins. If none of the men this week appealed to her, she had a new batch of bachelor males coming the next week.</p> <p>They were her cabins for now. The guests were all hers, too. When Hunter and Tessa returned, Meara intended to convince them to let her be in charge of renting the cabins permanently while they ran the pack. She would insist that would keep her well-occupied and happy, since she'd been none too happy to move here from the redwoods of California in the first place. Damned arsonists. If she could get away with it, she'd locate them and... well, they wouldn't be setting any more fires. Not unless they did so in hell.</p> <p>Thankfully, Hunter had two sub-leaders, Chris and Dave, to watch over the pack while she was given the job of maintaining the cabins. That meant the sub-leaders would be occupied as she actively looked over her mate prospects. Two weeks. That's all the time she had without her brother interfering and saying no to anyone she might be interested in. Not that she'd totally listen to him. But she hated how he always made her doubt herself about the men she'd been intrigued with. And once she'd hooked up with them?</p> <p>Yeah, as much as she hated to admit it, Hunter had always been right. In every case, they'd been the wrong sort for her. But she was determined to get it right this time. Without his brotherly advice!</p> <p>Of course, if none of these men were suitable, she'd keep looking. But she didn't believe she'd ever have a more perfect opportunity to be out from under Hunter's watchful eye than now.</p> <p>In her excitement, she rushed home to ready herself for her first guest's arrival, exceeding the speed limit just a little on the winding road. But she had to be prepared.</p> <p>Let's see. Snacks, drinks. Maybe dinner, even though it wasn't part of the paid "meal plan." But a light meal&#x2015;she'd made the perfect homemade German potato salad, just in case&#x2015;and conversation might go a long way toward quickly finding out as much as she could about each of her prospective guests.</p> <p>What would be the best way to entertain the male arriving tonight? A midnight, moonlit swim? The Pacific Ocean in these parts was cold any time of the year, but she was up for anything a potential mate might enjoy trying. A moonlit stroll in the woods? A run in their wolf coats? Dinner on the patio with glasses of red or white wine, the moon and a sprinkling of stars glowing overhead?</p> <p>Getting too cozy too early would be a mistake. She loved to run and she loved adventure, so curling up on the couch to watch a movie wasn't what she had in mind. Later, sure. But she had to know he'd want to do fun, adventurous activities. Not just lie around watching TV while sh...</p></p><h2>The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara Trilogy (Antrax / Morgawr / Ilse Witch)</h2><p>The<i> </i>New York Times bestselling author of the classic Shannara epic, Terry Brooks, has proven himself one of the modern masters of fantasy, brilliantly creating breathtaking worlds of magic, adventure, and intrigue.

High Art explores both the creation of psychedelia and the imagery born of this movement. It covers the Avalon and Fillmore ballrooms who commissioned the art, the UFO Club in London and features leading American artists, profiles of British artists and it describes the collectors&#39; experience.</p><p>No matter how high the hippies got, most had to come back to earth, cut their hair, get jobs, and "sell out" their counterculture. High Art flashes back to when love and LSD were free and psychedelic posters were not bankable art. The boldly and beautifully colored reproductions do the mystic and merry tripper's visions justice; however, after an insightful introduction to the social and political climate of the 1960s and the poster artists' influences, the written content of this book wavers. For the profiles of American poster artists and the rock venues and promoters that employed them, the authors reprinted deep but sometimes outdated pieces from the 1976 exhibition catalog San Francisco Rock Poster Art by historian Walter Medeiros. Their original coverage of the British scene with direct quotes from the artists is more engaging. Why psychedelic art blacked out in the 1980s and soared in popularity in the mid- and late 1990s is not explored either.

By the age of 22, Darin was a pop idol with chart-toppers "Splish Splash" and "Dream Lovers." A year later, he reinvented himself as a Sinatra-style crooner with "Mack the Knife" and "Beyond the Sea," winning a Grammy Award, the adulation of millions, a Hollywood contract, and a starlet wife, Sandra Dee. His sense of urgency drove him throughout his life and if it seemed as though Darin was trying to do it all, he was: a rheumatic heart doomed him to an early death. <i>Bobby Darin</i> examines the entertainer's entire life, from his boyhood in the Bronx, where he was born Walden Robert Cassotto, to his rise as a musical sensation, his rocky marriage to Sandra Dee, and the evolution of his career from pop idol to swingin' crooner to folk singer. Also detailed is the shocking secret Darin learned later in life&#x2014;that his "sister" Nina was actually his mother, and that Polly, the woman he thought was his mother, was actually his grandmother&#x2014;and how he spent the last five years of his life consumed by bitterness and anger over the betrayal. Interviews with such close friends and relatives as Steve Blauner, Darin's best friend and business manager, Gary Walden, Darin's half-brother, Dick Clark, Wayne Newton, Neil Sedaka, Tony Orlando, and many others will give the book a special intimacy and provide a deeply revealing portrait of the man.</p><p>Entertainment columnist for the <i>New York Post</i>, <b>Michael Seth Starr</b> is the author of <i>Mouse in the Rat Pack</i>, <i>Art Carney: A Biography</i>, and <i>Peter Sellers: A Film History</i>.In this straightforward biography, <i>New York</i><i>Post</i> entertainment columnist Starr (<i>Mouse in the Rat Pack</i>) relates the abbreviated life of singer and mid-century youth icon Darin (1936&#x2013;1973). Born Walden Robert Cassotto, Bobby was a sickly child eventually diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease. As Starr explains, Darin was propelled to stardom by the knowledge that his life would be short: by 22, he had worked his way out of the South Bronx and recorded his first hits, "Splish, Splash" and "Dream Lovers"; the following year he transformed his teeny-bopper image with the swinging, finger-snapping tune written by Kurt Weill and first popularized by Louis Armstrong, "Mack the Knife." He topped the song charts, appeared in movies (the first of which, <i>Come September</i>, starred his soon-to-be wife, Sandra Dee) and hosted his own variety show. He could be charming, arrogant and sometimes cruel: as a nightclub entertainer, he "shattered [the Copa's] old attendance record held by Frank Sinatra"; as an embittered son he died leaving nothing to his immediate family. Though it lags in spots, Starr's solid biography offers colorful quotes from Darin's friends, family and music business associates. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As a <p> young man, he planned to join the priesthood, but by 1960, on the verge of the Vietnam </p><p> War, Keneally found the church in such moral turmoil that he decided it was impossible </p><p> to go through with his ordination.</p><p> Keneally received his formal education in Sydney, Australia. Over the past 30 years, he </p><p> has published over 25 novels, more than a dozen screenplays, and several works of </p><p> non-fiction. These works include <i>The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith, The Playmaker, </i></p><p><i> Season in Purgatory, A Family Madness</i>, and <i>Woman of the Inner Sea.</i> His work</p><p> has been nominated four times for the Booker Prize, which he won in 1982 for <i>Schindler's </i></p><p><i> List</i>. He won the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Prize for Fiction, The Miles Franklin Award, The </p><p> Critics Circle Award, and a Logie (Australian Emmy).</p><p> A self-described "literary biker," Keneally has traveled through Australia, Iceland, Antarctica, </p><p> America, Eastern Europe, roaming across genres and topics, often championing the underdog. </p><p> "I'm a writer who's always been hard to pin down," Keneally says, "because I've sometimes </p><p> written about things that are none of my concern -- like the American South or Antarctica or</p><p> Australian aboriginals or the Holocaust. I think I appeal to 'hells angels' kind of writers." </p><p> Keneally has modeled many of his characters after the traditional Australian hero -- the </p><p> "battler." "In America everyone admires successful men and women. In Australia, they </p><p> suspect them. The Australian hero is the person to whom everything has happened -- </p><p> drought, fire, flood."</p><p> Oskar Schindler is a classic Keneally character -- conflicted and flawed, the antithesis of a </p><p> one-dimensional altruistic saint. And Schindler's story is a classic Keneally story -- an </p><p> ordinary man placed in a situation of enormous moral dilemma.</p><p> While researching <i>Schindler's List,</i> the author spent two years traveling to eight countries, where he interviewed many of Schindler's Jews and read the numerous testimonies which </p><p> are held at the Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Authority, Yad Vasbem, Israel.</p><p> Keneally lives in California where he teaches in the graduate writing program at the University of</p><p> California, Irvine, where he holds a Distinguished Professorship.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Reading Group Discussion Points</b></p><p><b>Other Books With Reading Group Guides</b></p><p></p><b>From Chapter One</b> <p>General Sigmund List's 5 armored divisions, driving north from the Sudetenland, had taken the sweet south Polish jewel of Cracow from both flanks on September 6, 1939. And it was in their wake that Oskar Schindler entered the city which, for the next five years, would be his oyster. Though within the month he would show that he was disaffected from National Socialism, he could still see that Cracow, with its railroad junction and its as yet modest industries, would be a boomtown of the new regime. He wasn't going to be a salesman anymore. Now he was going to be a tycoon. </p><p>It is not immediately easy to find in Oskar's family's history the origins of his impulse toward rescue. He was born on April 28, 1908, into the Austrian Empire of Franz Josef, into the hilly Moravian province of that ancient Austrian realm. His hometown was the industrial city of Zwittau, to which some commercial opening had brought the Schindler ancestors from Vienna at the beginning of the sixteenth century. </p><p>Herr Hans Schindler, Oskar's father, approved of the imperial arrangement, considered himself culturally an Austrian, and spoke German at the table, on the telephone, in business, in moments of tenderness. Yet when in 1918 Herr Schindler and the members of his family found themselves citizens of the Czechoslovak republic of Masaryk and Benes, it did not seem to cause any fundamental distress to the father, and even less still to his ten-year-old son. The child Hitler, according to the man Hitler, was tormented even as a boy by the gulf between the mystical unity of Austria and Germany and their political separation. No such neurosis of disinheritance soured Oskar Schindler's childhood. Czechoslovakia was such a bosky, unravished little dumpling of a republic that the German-speakers took their minority stature with some grace, even if the Depression and some minor governmental follies would later put a certain strain on the relationship. Zwittau, Oskar's hometown, was a small, coal-dusted city in the southern reaches of the mountain range known as the Jeseniks. Its surrounding hills stood partly ravaged by industry and partly forested with larch and spruce and fir. Because of its community of German-speaking <i>Sudetendeutschen,</i> it maintained a German grammar school, which Oskar attended. There he took the <i>Real-gymnasium</i> Course which was meant to produce engineers&#x2014;mining, mechanical, civil&#x2014;to suit the area's industrial landscape. Herr Schindler himself owned a farm-machinery plant, and Oskar's education was a preparation for this inheritance. </p><p>The family Schindler was Catholic. So too was the family of young Amon Goeth, by this time also completing the Science Course and sitting for the Matura examinations in Vienna. </p><p>Oskar's mother, Louisa, practiced her faith with energy, her clothes redolent all Sunday of the incense burned in clouds at High Mass in the Church of St. Maurice. Hans Schindler was the sort of husband who drives a woman to religion. He liked cognac; he liked coffeehouses. A redolence of brandy-warm breath, good tobacco, and confirmed earthiness came from the direction of that good monarchist, Mr. Hans Schindler. </p><p>The family lived in a modern villa, set in its own gardens, across the city from the industrial section. There were two children, Oskar and his sister, Elfriede. But there are not witnesses left to the dynamics of that household, except in the most general terms. We know, for example, that it distressed Frau Schindler that her son, like his father, was a negligent Catholic. </p><p>But it cannot have been too bitter a household. From the little that Oskar would say of his childhood, there was no darkness there. Sunlight shines among the fir trees in the garden. There are ripe plums in the corner of those early summers. If he spends a part of some June morning at Mass, he does not bring back to the villa much of a sense of sin. He runs his father's car out into the sun in front of the garage and begins tinkering inside its motor. Or else he sits on a side step of the house, filing away at the carburetor of the motorcycle he is building. </p><p>Oskar had a few middle-class Jewish friends, whose parents also sent them to the German grammar school. These children were not village Ashkenazim&#x2014;quirky, Yiddish-speaking, Orthodox&#x2014;but multilingual and not-so-ritual sons of Jewish businessmen. Across the Hana Plain and in the Beskidy Hills, Sigmund Freud had been born of just such a Jewish family, and that not so long before Hans Schindler himself was born to solid German stock in Zwittau. </p><p>Oskar's later history seems to call out for some set piece in his childhood. The young Oskar should defend some bullied Jewish boy on the way home from school. It is a safe bet it didn't happen, and we are happier not knowing, since the event would seem too pat. Besides, one Jewish child saved from a bloody nose proves nothing. For Himmler himself would complain, in a speech to one of his <i>Einsatzgruppen,</i> that every German had a Jewish friend. " 'The Jewish people are'going to be annihilated,' says every Party member. 'Sure, it's in our program: elimination of the Jews, annihilation&#x2014;we'll take care of it.' And then they all come trudging, eighty million worthy Germans, and each one has his one decent Jew. Sure, the others are swine, but this one is an A-One Jew." </p><p>Trying still to find, in the shadow of Himmler, some hint of Oskar's later enthusiasms, we encounter the Schindlers' next-door neighbor, a liberal rabbi named Dr. Felix Kantor. Rabbi Kantor was a disciple of Abraham Geiger, the German liberalizer of Judaism who claimed that it was no crime, in fact was praiseworthy, to be a German as well as a Jew. Rabbi Kantor was no rigid village scholar. He dressed in the modern mode and spoke German in the house. He called his place of worship a "temple" and not by that older name, "synagogue." His temple was attended by Jewish doctors, engineers, and proprietors of textile mills in Zwittau. When they traveled, they told other businessmen, "Our rabbi is Dr. Kantor&#x2014;he writes articles not only for the Jewish journals in Prague and Brno, but for the dailies as well." </p><p>Rabbi Kantor's two sons went to the same school as the son of his German neighbor Schindler. Both boys were bright enough eventually, perhaps, to become two of the rare Jewish professors at the German University of Prague. These crew-cut German speaking prodigies raced in knee pants around the summer gardens. Chasing the Schindler children and being chased. And Kantor, watching them flash in and out among the yew hedges, might have thought it was all working as Geiger and Graetz and Lazarus and all those other nineteenth-century German-Jewish liberals had predicted. We lead enlightened lives, we are greeted by German neighbors&#x2014;Mr. Schindler will even make snide remarks about Czech statesmen in our hearing. We are secular scholars as well as sensible interpreters of the Talmud. We belong both to the twentieth century and to an ancient tribal race. We are neither offensive nor offended against. Later, in the mid-1930s, the rabbi would revise this happy estimation and make up his mind in the end that his sons could never buy off the National Socialists with a German-language Ph.D.&#x2014;that there was no outcrop of twentieth-century technology or secular scholarship behind which a Jew could find sanctuary, any more than there could ever be a species of rabbi acceptable to the new German legislators. In 1936 all the Kantors moved to Belgium. The Schindlers never heard of them again. </p><p>Copyright � 1982 by Serpentine Publishing Co., PTY Ltd.</p></p><h2>Katie And The Mona Lisa</h2><p>The Mona Lisa beckons Kate inside the world&#39;s most famous painting, but she soon discovers that poor Mona Lisa hasn&#39;t had a visitor for hundreds of years, and Kate and Mona Lisa venture outside the painting in search of new friends throughout the museum.</p><p>James Mayhew trained at Maidstone College of Art and his first children&#39;s book, Katie&#39;s Picture Show was published in 1989.

A RITA Award winner, she holds a master&#39;s degree in social work from San Diego State University. Diane lives in North Carolina.In her latest off-the-rack tale of domestic miseries, Chamberlain, (Reflection, 1996, etc.) leads off with a sure-fire grabber--a young mother who flees cross-country with her adored baby son, after losing a custody battle. Along the way, she confronts a romantic complications, a mystery, and fatal violence. Susanna Miller, having seen the custody of 11-month-old Tyler (survivor of a serious heart condition) awarded to ex-husband Jim and his new wife Peggy, knows what she has to do. Beginning with a night exodus from Boulder, Colorado, Susanna will travel east, eventually settling in Maryland. She'll adopt the name ``Kim,'' and little Tyler will answer to ``Cody.'' Kim's only link to Boulder is the syndicated radio show of the man she loves--disc jockey Linc Sebastain, who once served a short sentence for murder. His victim was Susanna's childhood tormenter, whom Linc had known as a neighbor years before. It's Linc's past, and his present involvement in her life (along with her own few days in a mental institution), that contributed to Susanna's court KO. In Maryland, jumpy Kim finds pleasant people, particularly a local artist, the attractive Adam, who pronounces her talented. Adam makes advances, Kim communicates with Linc via fax, and Linc responds on the airwaves. Kim must soon make a terrible decision, however, involving her knowledge of the route of a serial bomber: If she alerts the police, she will certainly lose Cody permanently. Meantime, back in Boulder, Peggy, essentially a good sort, is rapidly learning that Jim is a liar and a cad. She readies a surprise, while Kim sets off to waylay the crazy, deadly bomber advancing in the dark. There'll be a nick-of-time appearance, as well as a sacrificial demise. Chamberlain paces the flight-or-fight phases of the runaway mother's story with thoroughly professional ease: Her stories never cut deep, but they do skim along at a cheerful speed.

Church and religion expert Diana Butler Bass wondered if this was true, and this book is the result of her extensive, three-year study of centrist and progressive churches across the country. Her surprising findings reveal just the opposite&#x2014;that many of the churches are flourishing, and they are doing so without resorting to mimicking the mega-church, evangelical style. </p><p><em>Christianity for the Rest of Us</em> describes this phenomenon and offers a how-to approach for Protestants eager to remain faithful to their tradition while becoming a vital spiritual community. As Butler Bass delved into the rich spiritual life of various Episcopal, United Methodist, Disciples of Christ, Presbyterian, United Church of Christ, and Lutheran churches, certain consistent practices&#x2014;such as hospitality, contemplation, diversity, justice, discernment, and worship&#x2014;emerged as core expressions of congregations seeking to rediscover authentic Christian faith and witness today. </p><p>This hopeful book, which includes a study guide for groups and individuals, reveals the practical steps that leaders and laypeople alike are taking to proclaim an alternative message about an emerging Christianity that strives for greater spiritual depth and proactively engages the needs of the world.</p></p><p><p>Diana Butler Bass is the author of eight books on American religion, including <em>Christianity After Religion</em>, <em>Christianity for the Rest of Us</em>, and <em>A People's History of Christianity</em>. She holds a Ph.D. in Religious Studies from Duke University, has taught at the college and graduate level, and is currently an independent scholar.

Think again, says Butler Bass (<i>The Practicing Congregation</i>) in this challenging and hopeful book, which summarizes the findings of a three-year study funded by the Lilly Endowment. Yes, many mainline churches are struggling, but not because liberal Christianity is a contradiction in terms. Rather, the old neighborhood Protestant church has fallen on hard times because the old neighborhood has been replaced by a strip mall. And many mainline churches are thriving. Butler Bass showcases 10 of them, including Redeemer UCC in New Haven, Conn., and Saint Mark (Lutheran) in Yorktown, Va. She then examines 10 practices, from hospitality to worship to vigorous theological discussion, and posits that these practices are the heartbeat of vital mainline churches. Her provocative conclusions include the observation that today's mainliners have redefined politics by favoring bottom-up acts of service over structural change. And, she says, the thriving congregations are neither red nor blue, but purple&#x2014;a mix of Democrats and Republicans. This is Bass's best book yet.<i> (Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

So I was too.<br><br>I'd defy the rules, and sit there for hours listening to my father's records. <br><br>Bird. <br><br>Coltrane. <br><br>Monk, Mingus and Miles. <br><br>Basie and Ellington. <br><br>Chuck Berry and Little Richard. <br><br>Don't know which sent me higher--the music or the mystery of how it played. I could hear the beats and feel the vibrations, but where did they come from? How did those funky sounds come out of the grooves on the disc? Through the needle? Down into the cabinet? How'd those paper cones behind the cloth speakers go thump? How did all those different sounds come out of there?<br><br>So I just sat for hours. Lost in the music, staring at the machine. Staring at the little red 'ON' switch like it was a piece of candy, all lit up. Whatever made it glow was glowing inside me. <br><br>Wanted to control it. Manipulate it. Make it do what I said. <br><br>If I only knew how it worked!<br><br>Which was when my arm got pulled back. Hard. So hard it almost came out of my shoulder.<br><br>I forgot. It was already six o' clock. I'd lost track of time. My father was home. He yanked me right out of the chair with one hand and hit me across my face with the other. Before my feet even touched the ground.<br><br><i>"What I tell you about coming in here?" <br><br>WHAP!<br><br>"What I tell you about messin' with my stuff?" <br><br>WHAP!<br></i><br>When Dad saw me in the living room, it was enough for him to put a whuppin' on my butt and put my hand to the radiator.<br><br><i>"That'll teach you about messin' with my stuff!"</i><br><br>What really set him off was me messin' with his records. It wasn't the first time I'd been in trouble, but this was different. This really twisted his cap. This was personal, and the beating was bad. Mommy got in the middle of it&#x2014;she always did&#x2014;and shielded me from the blows. But there was only so much she could stop.<br><br>I avoided the hospital, but not by much. <br><br>It was the first of many beatings. Yet for all my pain, I was only thinking two things: One, this phonograph equipment must be some special stuff for him to kick my ass like that. Two, don't ever stop the beat. So long as the music's playing, I'm safe.<br>Then came the beating of beatings.<br><b>DAD</b><br>I was almost seven. It was another Tuesday afternoon. It was cold out and the steam in the radiator was making the pipes rattle and hum. My hand was still sore from the last time Dad had put it there, but my fingers were tapping out a rhythm with the pipes that had me fiending for beats.<br><br>Violet was out with her boyfriend. Carmetta and my oldest sister, Regina, who we called Penny, were in their rooms. Mom had taken Lilly to the doctor, and Dad was at work. <br><br>Home alone. Just me and the music.<br><br>Mom and my sisters knew I was messin' with his stuff and told me not to, but I couldn't be stopped. One time, Penny asked me why I kept on messing with those records, bad as Dad hurt me. <br><br>Couldn't say. It was something I just had to do.<br><br>So I kept on doing it. I was big enough to reach the knob to the hall closet but needed a chair for the high shelves. That's where Dad kept all the good stuff. I knew there were jams at the top. I'd heard Dad and my big sister Violet say there was a new James Brown hit, and I had to hear it.<br><br>But the top shelf was way up high. Even standing on my dad's dining room chair--the one with the arms on it--I had to get on my tippy-toes and then, sometimes, I could reach the records I wanted to play.<br><br>Still, I could see the spine of the album cover, half an inch from my fingers. Close enough, I could feel its groove like electricity. So I jumped, got a hold and pulled.<br><br><i>Got it! </i><br><br>But the record next to it fell to the floor and cracked in a hundred pieces. I looked down and saw it was Billy Eckstine's <i>Jelly Jelly</i>. JB might have survived the fall but <i>Jelly Jelly</i> was an old shellac 78. No way.<br><br>That's when I heard a key in the door. And one of the arms on the chair snapping. And me falling.<br><br>It was Dad. <br><br>Dad was a boxer, just like his brother Sandy. Sandy was especially bad; fact is, he was the featherweight champ of the world in 1950, retired with a hundred and three knockouts and later voted one of <i>The Ring</i> Magazine's fifty greatest punchers of all time. Fighting spirit ran in the family.<br><br>Dad was also a trackman. He'd come home early from his gig with the Penn Central Railroad and he was shouting, <i>"Who's in my closet? Who's messing with my records?!"</i> Soon as he saw me and his shattered record, he grabbed my neck, lifted me off the floor, dragged me out of the closet, then let me have it for real.<br><br>Dad knocked me clean across the hall with a slap from his hand, his skin rough as sandpaper. Next thing I remember was waking up. Mommy was screaming and Lilly was crying. There was blood all over the front of my shirt and ringing in my ears.<br><br>When Mommy came home and tried to stop Dad, he went at her with an iron skillet. Beat on her until he finally busted her head open. Both of 'em screaming so loud, a neighbor finally called the cops. The cops knew where we lived and by then my father knew the drill--he skipped out before they came, leaving them to deal with Mommy. Disappearing back out into the street life; back into the bars and boxing gyms he loved more than home.<br><br>Days later he'd show up, arms full of groceries, acting like everything was okay. But the violence would start up all over again just as soon as Mommy started yelling and screaming how he was layed up with other women. Lots of 'em.<br><br>She knew 'cause sometimes they came to our door, pregnant, and saying Dad was the daddy. Saying he was with her now. Asking when he'd be home.

This series is aligned with the standards adopted by the California State Board of Education and follows the topical arrangement in the Primary Mathematics Standards Edition Textbooks. Each chapter comprises Test A and Test B, and each unit concludes with similarly structured Cumulative Tests. Test A consists of free response questions and assesses students&#39; grasp of mathematical concepts while developing problem-solving skills. Test B is optional and consists of multiple-choice questions aimed at testing students&#39; comprehension of key concepts. As such, it may be used as a retest if teachers perceive the need. In Cumulative Tests A and B, questions from earlier units are incorporated into each test. These tests focus on review and consolidation through the integration of concepts and strands. Primary Mathematics Standards Edition Tests aim to provide teachers with a set of structured assessment tools for the systematic evaluation of students&#39; learning so as to better understand their individual needs.</p><p></p><h2>Helping: How to Offer, Give, and Receive Help (The Humble Leadership Series)</h2><p>In this seminal book on helping, corporate culture and organizational development guru Ed Schein analyzes the dynamics of helping relationships, explains why help is often not helpful, and shows what any would-be-helper must do to insure that help is actually provided.<p>Many words are used for helping -- assisting, aiding, advising, coaching, consulting, counseling, supporting, teaching, and many more -- but they all have common dynamics and processes. Schein exposes and shows how to resolve the inequities and role ambiguities of helping relationships, describes the different roles that helpers can take once the relationship is balanced, and explains how to build a balanced relationship and how to intervene as that relationship develops. In this short but profound book Schein examines the social dynamics that are at play in helping relationships in order to better understand why offers of help are sometimes refused or resented, and how to make help more helpful.</p></p><p>Ed Schein was educated at the University of Chicago, Stanford University (where he received a master&#x2019;s degree in psychology in 1949), and Harvard University (where he received his Ph.D. in social psychology in 1952). He has taught at the MIT Sloan School of Management since 1956 and was named the Sloan Fellows Professor of Management in 1978. He is currently professor emeritus. He is the author of many articles and books, most recently Process Consultation Revisited (1999), The Corporate Culture Survival Guide (1999), and DEC Is Dead: Long Live DEC (2003). His book Organizational Culture and Leadership, 3rd ed. (2004) has defined the field of organizational culture. He has consulted with many organizations in the United States and overseas on organizational culture, organization development, process consultation, and career dynamics. What has distinguished Schein&#x2019;s work is his combination of sociology, anthropology, and social psychology, as illustrated in this book.Helpful and Unhelpful Help<br><br> Helping is a complex phenomenon. There&#x2019;s helpful help and unhelpful help. This book is written to shed light on the difference between the two. In my career as a professor and sometimes consultant I often reflect on what is helpful and what is not, why some classes go well and others do not, why coaching and experiential learning are often more successful than formal lectures. When I am with organizational clients, why does it work better to focus on process rather than content, or how things are done rather than what is done? My goal in this book is to provide the reader with enough insight to be able to actually help when help is asked for or needed, and to be able to receive help when help is needed and offered. Neither is as easy as we often wish.<br><br> The other day, for example, a friend asked me for some advice on how to deal with a problem he was having with his wife. I offered a suggestion to which he replied huffily that not only had he already tried that and it didn&#x2019;t work, but he also implied that I was insensitive to have even made that suggestion. It reminded me of many other situations I have witnessed where help was asked for or offered but the result felt unsuccessful and uncomfortable.<br><br> Then I was reminded of a case of helpful help. Outside my house a woman in her car drove up and asked me, &#x201c;How do I get to Massachusetts Ave.?&#x201d; I asked her where she was headed and learned that she wanted to go to downtown Boston. I then pointed out that the road she was on led directly to downtown and she did not need Mass. Ave. She thanked me profusely for not sending her to the street she had asked for.<br><br> The most common version of unhelpful help that I have experienced as both helper and client concerns the computer. When I call the help line I often don&#x2019;t even understand the diagnostic questions that the helper asks me in order to determine what help I need. When my computer coach tells me the several steps I need to take to solve the problem, I don&#x2019;t know how to interrupt to say, &#x201c;Wait, I don&#x2019;t understand the first step.&#x201d; On the other hand, another computer coach I hired asked me what my personal goals were in learning to use the computer, elicited my desire to use it primarily for writing, and then showed me all the programs and tools that would make writing easier. That felt great. Yet when my wife asks me for help with the computer, I routinely fall into the same trap of telling her what I would do, which turns out to be more than she can handle, and we both end up frustrated.<br><br> Friends, editors, consultants, teachers, and coaches have often made suggestions and proposals that were quite irrelevant to my problem at the time. Even when I ignored them as gently as I could, my sometimes self-appointed helpers reminded me in an irritated tone that they were only trying to be helpful, implying that I was wrong in some way not to have been able to accept the help.<br><br> I remember one of my children asking me for help with her math homework. I interrupted my work, did the problem for her, only to find her sulking off without a thank you. What had I done wrong? On another occasion a child asked for homework help and I said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s talk. . . .&#x201d; I discovered that she wanted to talk about some serious social problems at school that had nothing to do with homework. We had a good talk and both felt better.<br><br> Doctors, therapists, social workers, and coaches of all sorts have had the experience of the best-intended help going wrong somehow. As a consultant and career coach to managers in various kinds of organizations, I have often figured out solutions to problems that they posed, and only later discovered that either my advice did not work or the client could not or would not implement what I had suggested. I also remember in my own consulting how often it happened that when I intervened to point out some dysfunctional behavior in a group meeting, I was thanked for being very helpful, only to find that the behavior did not change one iota.<br><br> Help is, of course, not limited to the one-on-one situation. Group effort and teamwork often hinge on the degree to which members perform their roles properly in accomplishing the group&#x2019;s task. We do not typically think of an effective team as being a group of people who really know how to help each other in the performance of a task, yet that is precisely what good teamwork is&#x2014;successful reciprocal help. It is interesting to note, however, that the word &#x201c;help&#x201d; is only used in relation to teamwork when it does not occur, as when one group member says to another, &#x201c;What you did was not helpful&#x201d; or &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you help more?&#x201d;<br><br> Helping in a team context is most obvious in team sports, where the ability of one player to score is entirely dependent on the skill of others to pass or block. There are many football stories of successful runners taking their linemen out to dinner after a successful game in acknowledgment of their support. Failure to help in this regard becomes obvious when the quarterback is sacked or the runner is tackled behind the line.<br><br> Clearly, there is more to helping or being helped than meets the eye. This seemingly common and very necessary human process is, in fact, fraught with difficulty and often does not succeed. This book starts with the premise that help is an important but complicated human process. I examine what it really means to help or be helped; what psychological, social, and cultural traps are inherent in this process; and how one can avoid them. As the examples above show, help refers to many things other than the professional help we expect from doctors, lawyers, ministers and social workers. So what is it all about and how do we ensure that it works?<br><br> The Multiple Meanings of Help<br><br> Helping is a very broad concept ranging all the way from the knight in shining armor rescuing the maiden before she is eaten by the dragon to the consultant working with an organization to change its culture to meet new strategic objectives or to improve its performance. From a client perspective, help includes not only what we ask for, but also the spontaneous and generous behavior of others who recognize when we need help even if we have not asked for it.<br><br> Consider the many life situations in which helping of some sort is involved (see Table 1.1). It occurs all the time in both formal and informal situations, and many of the roles described in Table 1.1 are ones we are called on to play ourselves at various times in our lives. To go one step further, helping is intrinsic to all forms of organization and work, because, by definition, we organize because we cannot do the whole job ourselves. Hired help truly refers not only to servants and caretakers, but applies equally to all organizational employees hired to do a specific job that we cannot do ourselves. Fulfilling one&#x2019;s duties in a job is, therefore, also a routine way in which we help. Consider the tensions that arise between supervisors and subordinates when either the subordinate did not put forth the effort to complete the task or the boss did not provide the time or other resources to get the job done. Workers and their bosses have a sort of psychological contract based on what kind of help they can expect from each other.<br><br> TABLE 1.1 The Many Forms of Help<br><br> The stranger giving the tourist directions<br><br> The parent doing the child&#x2019;s homework<br><br> The spouse advising on what to wear for the party<br><br> The nurse assisting a patient with the bedpan<br><br> The friend supplying a word that is on the tip of your tongue<br><br> The guest offering to clear and do the dishes<br><br> The teacher explaining a concept to a student<br><br> The computer expert walking you through steps to fix a computer problem<br><br> The 911-hotline operator or suicide hotline operator advising someone in distress<br><br> The child showing a friend or parent how to use a new phone or video game<br><br> The coach showing the client how to improve some skill<br><br> The operating-room nurse handing the surgeon the right instrument just in time<br><br> The blocker creating a hole for the runner to run through<br><br> The executive coach advising a manager on how to handle subordinates<br><br> The improvisation team member setting up his/her partner to deliver the punch line and get the laugh<br><br> The counselor assisting a laid-off worker to find a new job/career<br><br> The boss advising subordinates how to do their job better<br><br> The assembly line worker putting his or her part in on time so that the line can move on<br><br> The caregiver ministering to a sick person<br><br> The lawyer advising and instructing the client on how to manage a divorce<br><br> The social worker suggesting how a family can cope with an economic crisis<br><br> The psychotherapist working with the client to cope with behavior problems or emotional difficulties<br><br> The minister showing a parishioner how to cope with guilt, grief or anxiety<br><br> The doctor diagnosing a patient and providing a prescription<br><br> The funeral director helping the grieving family cope with death<br><br> The consultant trying to improve the functioning of an organization<br><br> To illustrate further the extensive nature of this concept, note how many different words we use that mean to help in some way (see Table 1.2). Is there anything that all of these helping processes have in common? Is there an underlying cultural meaning that both helpers and clients need to understand better to improve the quality of help offered, given, asked for, and received? With the various kinds of help that exist&#x2014;physical help, emotional support, information, diagnostic insight, advice and recommendations&#x2014;do they need to be distinguished? How are they similar or different?<br><br> TABLE 1.2 The Many Words for Helping<br><br> Image<br><br> Formal and Informal Help<br><br> In the routine of daily life, help is the action of one person that enables another person to solve a problem, to accomplish something, or to make something easier. The person being helped might or might not have been able to do it alone, but helping implies that the task was made easier somehow, or, in the extreme, that it was accomplished at all (as when we save a drowning person). Help is thus the process that underlies cooperation, collaboration, and many forms of altruistic behavior. I will call this category &#x201c;informal&#x201d; help. In all cultures, this form of help is institutionalized and taken for granted as a basis for civilized society. It probably has some biological genetic basis since we know that non-human species engage in this behavior as well. Helping is part of what we think of as manners, rules of civilized behavior, and ethical and moral behavior. Such helping occurs all the time in a routine fashion. Note also that a request or offer of help cannot be ignored&#x2014;it has to be dealt with in some fashion or the social fabric is torn a little and the actors are embarrassed.<br><br> The next level of help can be thought of as &#x201c;semi-formal,&#x201d; where we go to technicians of various sorts to get help with our houses, cars, computers, and audio-visual equipment. Here we require help in making something work, are less involved personally, and pay for the service or information. Many of our most frustrating experiences both as clients and helpers occur in this domain because of our expectation that things should be easy to use and our unwillingness to adapt to new languages and routines such as those required by computers.<br><br> &#x201c;Formal&#x201d; help is needed when we are in some kind of personal, health, or emotional difficulty and need medical, legal, or spiritual assistance from someone licensed to provide such assistance. We go to doctors, lawyers, priests, counselors, social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists for individual attention. When in our managerial and organizational roles we have problems of governance and organizational performance, we go to consultants of various sorts. In these cases the help comes from professionals and is a more formal process that implies contracts, timetables, and the exchange of money or other valuables for services. Most analyses of help deal with this formal level, yet informal and semi-formal help are far more common and often have greater consequences if not given or received effectively.<br><br> We will consider whether the help that occurs in more formal situations is different from the day-to-day informal and semi-formal help. What do effective trained and licensed helpers do that makes them more or less successful, and what can we learn from them to enhance our skills in less formal settings? Equally relevant is to ask what the trained helper can learn from a closer examination of the dynamics of informal and semi-formal help.<br><br> Helping Is a Social Process<br><br> Helping involves more than one person, so I will concentrate on how to think about and define the helping relationship. That focus will, in turn, lead us to a discussion of what is involved in any relationship and what it means to have a good relationship, one in which we can trust each other and can communicate openly.<br><br> All relationships are governed by cultural rules that tell us how to behave in relation to each other so that social intercourse is safe and productive. We call this good manners, tact, or etiquette. Underneath this surface level of overt behavior lie powerful rules that must be followed for society to work at all. Some of these rules vary according to the situation, but in any given culture there will be a set of universal rules that, if violated, cause the person to be ostracized or isolated. When they are violated in an ongoing interaction we become offended, embarrassed, or suspicious that the relationship is not good. This may result in a lack of trust or hurt feelings if the client felt that no help was provided, or the helper felt refused or ignored.<br><br> Though helping is a relationship, the process of offering, giving, or receiving semi-formal or formal help usually starts with individual initiative. What we must understand, then, is how the initial contact between the potential helper and potential client evolves into a relationship that produces help. Someone decides to give or offer help, and that action may lead to a helping relationship; or someone may ask for help, which could also result in a helping relationship. A team leader brings together a bunch of people and creates a relationship-building process that leads to mutual helping among team members. A consultant helps a manager organize different units so that they can help each other in achieving organizational tasks. Sometimes a group or community recognizes that it collectively needs help, but someone must articulate the need and bring it to public consciousness. A relational helping process can then be created.<br><br> The first thing to focus on, therefore, is how personal initiative leads to a relationship. If we understand the dynamics of building any relationship, we can build a more effective helping relationship.<br><br> In the next chapters I will examine what some of the ultimate rules are that govern relationships and how they apply to helping relationships. We will examine the inequities and role ambiguities of helping relationships, the different roles that helpers can take once the relationship is balanced and comfortable, how to build such a relationship, and how to intervene as the client/helper relationship evolves.</p><h2>Art Therapy for Groups: A Handbook for Themes, Games, and Exercises</h2><p>Specific examples and real reminiscences.</p><p>Lieberman's book is in its 3rd printing for good reason: practitioners have found it to be immensely useful and practical. The first part contains discussions of the field of art therapy, stories and examples from practice, and extensive considerations on working with a wide range of groups, including psychiatric In- and Day patients, the elderly, staff groups, ex-offenders, mixed groups of children and adults, women's groups, and many others. <p>The second part is full of roll-up-your-sleeves ideas. They include activities and games for all kinds of groups (an entire chapter is devoted to group painting), considerations of media, and stimulating concepts to start things moving. </p><p>This bibliography is definitive and usefully grouped by chapter. Both sections of the book benefit from pictures of groups at work, as well as many examples of art made using the exercises in the book.</p></p><h2>The Norton anthology of poetry</h2><p>The fourth edition of this standard work contains 1800 poems by 300 poets, with 600 poems and 100 poets newly included. The anthology offers more poetry by women (40 new poets), with special attention to early women poets. The book also includes a greater diversity of American poetry, with double the number of poems by African American, Hispanic, native American and Asian American poets. There are 26 new poets representing the Commonwealth literature tradition: now included are more than 37 poets from Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Caribbean, South Africa and India. A reconsideration of many classic poets, from Shakespeare and Bradstreet to Larkin and Rich has been added in this edition, together with a wider representation of the beginnings of poetry in English: the Anglo-Saxon &#34;Caedmon&#39;s Hymn&#34; and selections from &#34;Beowulf&#34;, as well as Middle English lyrics, popular riddles, romance, allegory, and the verse tales of Chaucer and Langland, are now included. The collection also includes short biographical sketches and a system of annotation.</p><p>The Arc Inside And Out; For Harold Bloom <i>by Archie Randolph Ammons</i><br> The City Limits <i>by Archie Randolph Ammons</i><br> Corsons Inlet <i>by Archie Randolph Ammons</i><br> Easter Morning <i>by Archie Randolph Ammons</i><br> Kind <i>by Archie Randolph Ammons</i><br> Pet Panther <i>by Archie Randolph Ammons</i><br> Poetics <i>by Archie Randolph Ammons</i><br> The Put-down Come On <i>by Archie Randolph Ammons</i><br> Silver <i>by Archie Randolph Ammons</i><br> Small Song <i>by Archie Randolph Ammons</i><br> So I Said I Am Ezra <i>by Archie Randolph Ammons</i><br> Dover Beach <i>by Matthew Arnold</i><br> Isolation: To Marguerite - Continued <i>by Matthew Arnold</i><br> The Scholar-gipsy <i>by Matthew Arnold</i><br> Shakespeare <i>by Matthew Arnold</i><br> Thyrsis <i>by Matthew Arnold</i><br> Everyman's Library <i>by John Ashbery</i><br> Faust <i>by John Ashbery</i><br> Melodic Trains <i>by John Ashbery</i><br> The Painter <i>by John Ashbery</i><br> Paradoxes And Oxymorons <i>by John Ashbery</i><br> The Animals In That Country <i>by Margaret Atwood</i><br> At The Tourist Center In Boston <i>by Margaret Atwood</i><br> Songs Of The Transformed: Pig Song <i>by Margaret Atwood</i><br> Spelling <i>by Margaret Atwood</i><br> They Eat Out <i>by Margaret Atwood</i><br> This Is A Photograph Of Me <i>by Margaret Atwood</i><br> You Begin <i>by Margaret Atwood</i><br> You Fit Into Me <i>by Margaret Atwood</i><br> At The Grave Of Henry James <i>by Wystan Hugh Auden</i><br> For What As Easy <i>by Wystan Hugh Auden</i><br> In Praise Of Limestone <i>by Wystan Hugh Auden</i><br> Law Like Love <i>by Wystan Hugh Auden</i><br> Musee Des Beaux Arts <i>by Wystan Hugh Auden</i><br> Our Bias <i>by Wystan Hugh Auden</i><br> The Shield Of Achilles <i>by Wystan Hugh Auden</i><br> Song <i>by Wystan Hugh Auden</i><br> In Memory Of Radio <i>by Amiri Baraka</i><br> It's Nation Time <i>by Amiri Baraka</i><br> The New World <i>by Amiri Baraka</i><br> East Coast Journey <i>by James Keir Baxter</i><br> Jerusalem Sonnets: 1 <i>by James Keir Baxter</i><br> Lament For Barney Flanagan <i>by James Keir Baxter</i><br> Wild Bees <i>by James Keir Baxter</i><br> The Ball Poem <i>by John Berryman</i><br> The Dream Songs: 1 <i>by John Berryman</i><br> The Dream Songs: 155 <i>by John Berryman</i><br> The Dream Songs: 29 <i>by John Berryman</i><br> The Dream Songs: 375.

His great epic, <i>Shahnameh</i>, was originally composed for the Samanid princes of Khorasan. Ferdowsi died around 1020 in poverty.<br> <b>Dick Davis</b> is currently professor of Persian at Ohio State University and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. His translations from Persian include <i>The Lion and the Throne, Fathers and Sons, Sunset of Empire: Stories from the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi, Vols. I, II, III.</i><br> <b>Azar Nafisi</b> is the author of <i>Reading Lolita in Tehran</i>, an international bestseller.The Shahnameh is the great epic of ancient Persia, opening with the creation of the universe and closing with the Arab Muslim conquest of the worn-out empire in the 7th century. In its pages, the 11th-century poet Abolqasem Ferdowsi chronicles the reigns of a hundred kings, the exploits of dozens of epic heroes and the seemingly never-ending conflict between early Iran and its traditional enemy, the country here called Turan (a good-sized chunk of Central Asia). To imagine an equivalent to this violent and beautiful work, think of an amalgam of Homer's Iliad and the ferocious Old Testament book of Judges.<p> But even these grand comparisons don't do the poem justice. Embedded in the Shahnameh are love stories, like that of Zal and Rudabeh, that recall the heartsick yearnings of Proven�al troubadours and their ladies; tragedies of mistaken identity, hubris and irreconcilable moral obligations that might have attracted Sophocles; and meditations on the brevity of life that sound like Ecclesiastes or Horace. Though ostensibly historical, the poem is also full of myth and legend, of fairies and demons, of miraculous births and enchanted arrows and terrible curses, of richly caparisoned battle-elephants and giant birds straight out of the Arabian Nights. Little wonder that artists have often taken its stories as the inspiration for those manuscript illuminations we sometimes call Persian miniatures.</p><p>All this is swell, a modern reader is likely to think, but can Americans living in the 21st century actually turn the pages of the Shahnameh with anything like enjoyment? Yes, they can, thanks to Dick Davis, our pre-eminent translator from the Persian (and not only of medieval poems, but also of Iraj Pezeshkzad's celebrated comic novel, My Uncle Napoleon). Davis's diction in this largely prose version of the Shahnameh possesses the simplicity and elevation appropriate to an epic but never sounds grandiose; its sentences are clear, serene and musical. At various heightened moments -- usually of anguish or passion -- Davis will shift into aria-like verse, and the results remind us that the scholar and translator is also a noted poet:</p><p>Our lives pass from us like the wind, and why Should wise men grieve to know that they must die?</p><p>The Judas blossom fades, the lovely face Of light is dimmed, and darkness takes its place.</p><p>The world is pleasure first, then grief, and then We leave this fleeting world of living men -- Our beds are dust, for all eternity, Why should we plant the tree we'll never see?</p><p>Many of the episodes of the Shahnameh clearly draw from the same teeming ocean of story known to Western poets and mythmakers. Old King Feraydun divides greater Persia into three realms, one for each of his sons, and the two older brothers conspire against the youngest, with bloody centuries-long consequences. The champion Rostam boldly undertakes seven Herculean trials. Kay Kavus's entire army is scourged with blindness by the White Demon. A heroic warrior meets his own valiant and unrecognized son on the field of battle (English majors will remember this as the subject of Matthew Arnold's poem "Sohrab and Rustum"); Kay Khosrow fasts and meditates, like Buddha, and then renounces the throne and earthly vanity to ascend into heaven. There's even an example of that misogynistic favorite about the high-ranking older woman (Potiphar's wife, for instance, or Phaedra) who lusts after a forbidden younger man, in this case her stepson: "Now when the king's wife, Sudabeh, saw Seyavash, she grew strangely pensive and her heart beat faster; she began to waste away like ice before fire, worn thin as a silken thread." But, as in Racine, Ferdowsi makes us feel the middle-aged Sudabeh's torment:</p><p>"But look at me now," she implores Seyavash. "What excuse can you have to reject my love, why do you turn away from my body and beauty? I have been your slave ever since I set eyes on you, weeping and longing for you; pain darkens all my days, I feel the sun itself is dimmed. Come, in secret, just once, make me happy again, give me back my youth for a moment."</p><p>The story of Seyavash is a study in conflicting loyalties, like so much of the Shahnameh. The blood relations between Iran and Turan are intricate, as many of the major characters can trace their lineage back to Feraydun, and even traditional enemies occasionally intermarry. In fact, the most common theme of the epic is the tension between fathers and sons, often of kings who don't want to relinquish power and younger men who want to prove they deserve it. Aging Goshtasp can't bear to give up his kingship, even to his own son. So he sends the noble young warrior on an impossible mission: to bring the proud and invincible Rostam back to the court in chains. In truth, there's no good reason for this order, as that hero has long been a loyal defender of one unworthy Iranian king after another. But Esfandyar owes obedience to his father and his sovereign, even as he recognizes the injustice, indeed the senselessness of the command. Worse yet, Rostam admires the young man and so urges every possible escape clause, even agreeing to return to the Persian court -- but not in chains, for he has pledged never to be bound. In the end, two admirable men, caught between mutually opposing vows, must reluctantly meet in armed combat to the death.</p><p>Rostam is a recurrent figure throughout the first half of the Shahnameh. He lives for 500 years, swings his mace like a Middle Eastern Thor, and is usually called upon when times grow truly desperate. When young, Rostam searched for a horse that could support his mammoth size and weight. He finally found Rakhsh, as famous in Persian lore as Pegasus in Greek mythology. What, he asks, is the cost of this formidable animal? The herdsman replies, "If you are Rostam, then mount him and defend the land of Iran. The price of this horse is Iran itself, and mounted on his back you will be the world's savior." </p><p>Rostam also shares, with Odysseus, a liking for sly humor. Once, on a secret mission to a land of sorcerers, people begin to suspect him of being Rostam because of his great strength. He innocently replies: "I don't know if I'm worthy even to be Rostam's servant. I can't do the things he does; he is a champion, a hero, a great horseman." Another time in battle, he seizes an enemy by his belt, which breaks, and the man escapes. Rostam berates himself, "Why didn't I tuck him under my arm, instead of hanging on to his belt?" The old hero finally dies in a trap constructed by his own stepbrother, but not before he uses his last ounce of strength to notch an arrow and send it through the trunk of the tree behind which the murderer thinks he is safe.</p><p>The wily Turanian King Afrasyab is nearly as long-lived as Rostam and somehow manages to escape time and again from certain death. His machinations power much of the first half of the Shahnameh. Afrasyab is nothing if not a Machiavellian realist and one of the most vivid and complex characters in the poem. As a young man, he recognizes the folly of war with Iran's Kay Qobad and so advises his shortsighted father: "War with Iran seemed like a game to you, but this has proven to be a hard game for your army to play. Consider how many golden helmets and golden shields, how many Arab horses with golden bridles, how many Indian swords with golden scabbards, and how many famous warriors Qobad has ruined. And worse than this, your name and reputation, which can never be restored, have been destroyed." He concludes by saying, "Don't think of past resentments, try to be reconciled." The lessons of history, as they say.</p><p> There's much more to the Shahnameh than I've touched on here. Because the poem's geography is largely the Eastern empire, Ferdowsi makes no mention of such famous Persian kings as Darius or Xerxes (though Alexander the Great does appear under the name Sekandar). Instead we learn about figures like Bahram Gur, who enjoyed hunting with cheetahs, once killed a rhinoceros with a dagger and eventually thwarted an invasion by the emperor of China. </p><p>For all their richness, though, long poems sometimes fall prey to a certain repetitiousness, and the wise reader will want to parcel out this one over time. Yet the epic scale of the book shouldn't overshadow its memorable smaller moments, or even some of its single sentences. One beautiful woman's mouth is described as "small, like the contracted heart of a desperate man." A seductive witch appears to Rostam, "full of tints and scents." A king's three daughters, "as lovely as the gardens of paradise, were brought before him, and he bestowed jewelry and crowns on them that were so heavy they were a torment to wear." As Ferdowsi quietly writes, "So the world went forward, and things that had been hidden were revealed." The Shahnameh eventually concludes with the death of the last king of the Sasanian dynasty and the passing of pre-Islamic Iran. Yet the poet can rightly sing:</p><p>I shall not die, these seeds I've sown will save My name and reputation from the grave, And men of sense and wisdom will proclaim, When I have gone, my praises and my fame.</p><p>Thanks to Davis's magnificent translation, Ferdowsi and the Shahnameh live again in English. </p><p>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Orr, who operated steam-powered freight and passenger trains throughout central Pennsylvania and south-central New York. From 1904 to 1949, Orr sat at the controls of many famous steam locomotives; moved trains loaded with coal, perishables, and other freight; and encountered virtually every situation a locomotive engineer of that era could expect to see. </p><p>John W. (Jack) Orr, Oscar&#x2019;s son, tells his father&#x2019;s story, which begins at the Central Steam Heating Plant in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. Oscar operated nearly every kind of steam locomotive the Pennsylvania Railroad owned, working from the bottom of the roster to the top position (number one in seniority). Orr has an ear for detail and a vivid memory. He tells about his father&#x2019;s first encounter with an automobile along the right-of-way, about what it was like to operate a train in a blizzard, and about the difficulties railroadmen encountered in stopping a trainload of tank cars loaded with oil in order to take on water and coal&#x2014;and many other stories. </p><p>This compelling railroad history will enthrall not only everyone in the railroad community but also the general reader interested in railroads and trains, past and present.</p></p><p><p>John W. Orr graduated from Penn State in 1949. Recently deceased, he resided in Ralston, Pennsylvania.</p>&#x201c;An engaging book, one likely to become a railroad classic. The major strength of <i>Set Up Running</i> is detail, particularly when it involves locomotives, train movements, and patterns of operation. Especially enjoyable are the depictions of Orr as a loyal Pennsylvania Railroad employee and of his overall pride of workmanship.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;H.

And it wasn&#x2019;t long before that large man, clad in blue overalls, came through the door with his travel bag, which he promptly set on the kitchen floor so he could pick me up. There was a strange smell on his overclothes, but it was not offensive, and it was one that I later learned belonged to a steam engine. So from very early in my life I developed an avid interest in the steam engine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;John W. (Jack) Orr, <i>Exerpt</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Set Up Running</i> is a book well worth reading even if you are not a railroad enthusiast. It helps to illuminate a part of the vanishing past when Williamsport was a major rail hub. The book is a major contribution to an important aspect of the social history of the area. There are plenty of references to local towns and spots to make it interesting to area readers. But, perhaps more importantly, it&#x2019;s just a good story written with love and respect for a man and a time by his son.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Lou Hunsinger Jr., <i>Williamsport Sun-Gazette</i><br><br>&#x201c;Rather than a glamorized, rosy look at the days of steam, the accounts of O.P. and John reveal railroading as seen through the eyes of those who handled and lived with the railroad day after day. . . . <i>Set Up Running </i>is a must-read for the Pennsy fan, and a truly rare treasure for those wanting to know the lives of the men who truly kept American steam locomotives running.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Alexander D. Mitchell IV, <i>Railfan and Railroad</i><br><br>&#x201c;Through true-life experiences, the reader gets an idea what it was like to work on a railroad in general and a steam engine specifically.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;John Beague, <i>Harrisburg Patriot News</i><br><br>&#x201c;[Q]uite simply one of the liveliest and most informative works of railroad history to come along in many years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Michael Bezilla, <i>Pennsylvania History</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Set Up Running </i>describes life in engine service as seldom told before. You will like it. The good and the bad, the long, long nights, broken knuckles, pulled couplers, firemen that don&#x2019;t know how to fire and don&#x2019;t want to learn, derailments, engines that won&#x2019;t steam, washouts &#x2014;it&#x2019;s all here. Not only is this an unvarnished story of what engine service was really like but it is also a valuable sociological portrait of railroading seldom explored in this detail. This was a difficult book for me to lay aside. . . . You will enjoy riding with engineer O.P. Orr in this true story of running an engine in the days of steam.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Robert E. McMillan, <i>Lexington Quarterly</i><br><br>&#x201c;For students of the Pennsylvania Railroad, Orr provides an interesting perspective with his view from the cab. . . . the level of detail is incredible as Orr successfully tempers the romance with the reality of an engineman&#x2019;s life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Robert M. Blackson, <i>Railroad History</i><br><br>&#x201c;Still the book is an amazing document of a fufilling life in industrial America. It is a good read, even though there are no plot twists or shattering climaxes. One comes away with a deepened sense that the bargain between capitalist and worker was arms-length but genuine, that hard work paid and a working life was rewarding.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Richard Saunders, <i>Labor History</i><br><br>&#x201c;The cumulative effect is an extended meditation on a lost world of rugged, single-minded men&#x2014;almost monkish in their devotion to their job and &#x2018;the company,&#x2019;&#x2014;who once thread[ed] their engines along river banks and down grades to deliver carloads of coal and lumber and merchandise to larger towns, where the freight was reshuffled into other trains and delivered to virtually every point on the continent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Mark Reutter, <i>Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography</i></p></p><h2>Fred &amp; Rose: The Full Story of Fred and Rose West and the Gloucester House of Horrors</h2><p><p><i>There is a newer edition of this item available here: </i><i>https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fred-Rose-Story-Gloucester-Horrors/dp/0751577502/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1549882974&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=9780751577501 </i></p><p>The true crime bestseller about Fred and Rose West a couple virtually unique in British criminal history - who loved and killed together as husband and wife.</p><p>During their long relationship the Wests murdered a series of young women, burying the remains of nine victims under their home at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, including those of their teenage daughter, Heather.

Along with her husband, Seif Chirchi, Yang serves food that exemplifies cross-cultural cooking at its most gratifying. In the cookbook you&#x2019;ll find the restaurants&#x2019; kimchi recipe, of course, but there&#x2019;s so much more&#x2014;seaweed noodles with crab and cr�me fra�che, tahini-garlic grilled pork belly, fried cauliflower with miso bagna cauda, chipotle-spiked pad thai, Korean-taco pickles, and the ultimate Korean fried chicken (served with peanut brittle shards for extra crunch). There are rice bowls too&#x2014;with everything from lamb curry to charred shiitake mushrooms&#x2014;but this book goes way beyond <i>bibimbap</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> In many ways, the book, like Yang&#x2019;s restaurants, is analogous to a rice bowl; underpinning everything is Yang&#x2019;s strict childhood in Korea and the food memories it engrained in her. But on top you&#x2019;ll taste a mosaic of flavors from across the globe, plus a dash of her culinary alma maters, Per Se and Alain Ducasse. This is the authentic, cutting-edge fusion food of a Korean immigrant who tried everything she could to become an American, but only became one when she realized that her culture&#x2014;among many&#x2014;is what makes America so delicious today.</p><p>RACHEL YANG and her husband, Seif Chirchi, own and operate Joule, Revel, and Trove restaurants in Seattle, and Revelry in Portland.

But these tiny insects, once merely a seasonal annoyance, now are capturing headlines worldwide as new information emerges about the diseases they carry, their migratory population, and their growing resistance to pesticides.</p><p>Harvard professor Andrew Spielman has dedicated his life to understanding this insect, a passion that makes him the perfect guide to their amazing world and the perfect author of this lively, accessible book that offers an intriguing and horrifying mosquito-eye view of nature and man. He explains where mosquitoes breed, and how they die, showing us their natural foes and man-made enemies while explaining the myriad diseases they bring to all corners of the world. Spielman offers colorful examples of how the mosquito has insinuated itself into human history, from the defeat of Sir Francis Drake's fleet to the death of thousands of Frenchmen working on the Panama Canal to the recent widespread West Nile panic in New York City. Filled with little-known facts and illuminating anecdotes that bring this tiny being into larger focus, <em>Mosquito</em> offers fascinating, alarming, and convincing evidence that the sooner we get to know this little creature, the better off we'll be.</p></p><p>Far from being just an itchy annoyance, a mosquito bite can also mark the transmission of a deadly disease. Millions worldwide die of malaria, yellow fever, and West Nile virus every year. Scientist Andrew Spielman tells the story of the tiny, ubiquitous insect, the diseases it carries, and the fight against them both in <i>Mosquito</i>.<p> Spielman, who has spent much of his career battling mosquitoes and mosquito-borne illness, knows his subject intimately--perhaps too intimately, as the section on the different species drags a bit. Better is his handling of various historic epidemics, from the malaria outbreak that caused the French to abandon the Panama Canal to the 1999 West Nile virus outbreak in New York City.</p><p> Spielman also recounts stories of how the tiny pests were thwarted, including the way DDT came to be used as a weapon in the cold war (take our side and we'll get rid of your mosquitoes)--and why these efforts ultimately failed. Most important, Spielman details how cities should prepare themselves for the inevitable epidemics ahead. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>Andrew Spielman, Sc.D. is one of the world's foremost authorities on mosquitoes and the infections that they transmit. He is Harvard University's senior investigator in tropical disease. His several hundred scientific publications on the subject deal with malaria, encephalitis, filariasis, dengue, and various tick-borne pathogens. Professor Spielman is the current director of the Center for International Development's new effort to develop a global anti-malarial strategy.

Set in a poor village in Henan province, it is a deeply moving and beautifully written account of a blood-selling ring in contemporary China. Based on a real-life blood-selling scandal in eastern China, <i>Dream of Ding Village</i> is the result of three years of undercover work by Yan Lianke, who worked as an assistant to a well-known Beijing anthropologist in an effort to study a small village decimated by HIV/AIDS as a result of unregulated blood selling. Whole villages were wiped out with no responsibility taken or reparations paid. <i>Dream of Ding Village</i> focuses on one family, destroyed when one son rises to the top of the Party pile as he exploits the situation, while another son is infected and dies. The result is a passionate and steely critique of the rate at which China is developing and what happens to those who get in the way.</p><p>Yan Lianke was born in 1958 in Henan Province, China. He is the author of many novels and short-story collections, and has won China&#x2019;s two top literary awards, the Lu Xun in 2000 for Nian, yue, ri (The Year, the Month, the Day), and the Lao She in 2004 for Shouhuo (Pleasure).A powerful look at the AIDS scandal in Henan province during the 1990s when many people became infected with HIV after selling their blood at private collection centers, Yan&#x2019;s evocative novel focuses on one family at the heart of the tragedy in the fictional Ding Village . . . Communist ideals battle against capitalistic impulses and human nature in this grand, layered novel, a must-read for anyone interested in present-day China.&#x201d; Booklist (starred review)<br><br> Gripping, swift, heartfelt, occasionally exhilarating and often surprising . . . Like Albert Camus' The Plague, the novel works on more than one level, not only as a commentary on the growth of modern China but opening outward into an existential parable about what human beings think is important in this short, short life. All of us are living in Ding Village, infected with death and waiting out our days. In these lives, with a heightened awareness of death, every second counts, every bit of happiness matters. As they should in our own.&#x201d; Nick DiMartino, Shelf Awareness<br><br> Censored in China, the latest novel by Yan (Serve the People!) to be translated into English is a brutal morality tale of a country undergoing transition Written after three years of clandestine research on a real-life blood-selling scandal that was widespread in China, this book shines another grim spotlight on China&#x2019;s abuses.

Illustrated in B/W and color. 143p. Measures 10 inches square. Topics include his boyhood, outdoor light and color, his ideas on art, Homer&#39;s relation to Impressionism and more.</p><p>The 19th-century realist Winslow Homer first gained wide renown with his Civil War battlefield illustrations in Harper's Weekly. A year spent in Paris after the war led to a greater acuity of vision, and by the mid-1870s he was one of the leading progenitors of naturalism and the most celebrated American painter of his day. Known for his watercolors, which have all the intensity and ardor of the most accomplished oil paintings, the solid outlines and luminosity of his surfaces show little influence from his contemporaries the Impressionists. His art was unquestionably individual and native. He was a reclusive outdoorsman who captured dozens of scenes highlighting the milieus he loved: seafaring vessels, Adirondack and Canadian hunting grounds, Bahamian beaches, and the rocky coast of Maine, to which he retreated in his last years. This outstanding new book is the catalog of a retrospective of 235 paintings touring East Coast museums?the largest gathering of his work ever. Cikovsky and Kelly (curators of American and British art at the National Gallery of Art) divide his career into eight chronological chapters, each with a straightforward, expository essay securely planting the work in a geographical and biographical context. The format is large but unostentatious, striking the perfect balance between text and illustration. This is easily the fairest, most intelligent, and best survey to date on this popular American master.?Douglas F. Smith, Oakland P.L., Cal.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Winslow Homer (1836^-1910) was in the news as a comprehensive retrospective of his magnificent paintings and watercolors opened at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., an exhibition that will live on between the covers of this spectacular volume. Cikovsky and Kelly, curators at the National Gallery, present a contextually rich and vibrant analysis of Homer's life and groundbreaking work. A self-taught artist with an "almost sensuous love of paint," Homer, like so many of his contemporaries, was deeply affected by the Civil War. His early illustrations and paintings demonstrate his "technical strength and assurance; color, modeling, and drawing; truthfulness, and lack of sentimentality," qualities he would elevate to new levels as he moved on to paint candid scenes of everyday life. There is an earthy grace to his dignified, hardworking figures, many of whom gaze contemplatively out into the distance, a gaze not unlike that of the artist himself. The authors track Homer's major themes, all of which are intrinsically connected to place, and discuss the progression from ideology to aesthetics, from shimmering pastoral romance to dark and stormy seas. Homer was a master not only of technique but also of interpreting light, motion, and our complex relationship with nature. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Ladd: The Life, The Legend, The Legacy of Alan Ladd: A Biography</h2><p>Alan Ladd, he &#34;blazed across the screen like a young Greek god&#34; in the 1940s and 1950s in such films as This Gun for Hire, The Blue Dahlia and Shane to become one of Hollywood&#39;s Biggest stars.

Reprint.</p><p>There's something for everyone in the British Crime Writers Association's second annual collection, which features not only a lineup of the usual suspects--23 stories, all but three of them new--but also some offbeat items: another double-crostic and a brace of Clewsey cartoons, verse by Susan Kelly, a reprint of Eric Ambler's rueful look back on his first novel, and historian Carole Rawcliffe's survey of the more flagrantly criminal members of medieval Parliaments. The more orthodox entries, though not notable for originality, are almost uniformly accomplished, especially Ellis Peters's ghostly whimsy, Eric Wright's stolid tale of petty revenge gone awry, Anthea Fraser's piquant variations on a bit on the side, Ian Rankin's lethal hostage-taking, and Robert Barnard's nimble dispatching of a tabloid king. Even the more routine stories (by Margaret Yorke, Antonia Fraser, Peter O'Donnell, Jonathan Gash, et al.) revel in extra twists and turns, and the reprints--Peter Lovesey's ``The Curious Computer,'' Tony Hillerman's ``First Lead Gasser,'' and Sue Grafton's ``A Little Missionary Work''--are equally strong. The level of craftsmanship and the variety of tone and technique are impressive. All in all, a model anthology. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Edited by crime-fiction veterans Cody and Lewin, the Crime Writers' Association Annual offers a choice, eclectic gathering of largely unpublished crime short stories. Peter Lovesey evokes the spirit of Baker Street as some English criminal types enlist an eccentric hacker to do battle with Scotland Yard's new computer, and events become distinctly ghostly and Holmesian. Margaret Yorke follows an unhappy couple on vacation: although both husband and wife hatch plans to end their unhappiness, the wishes of only one approach realization. In Reginald Hill's "True Thomas," a bitter copper tells the truth, the whole truth and nothing but for 24 hours--with comic, chaotic results. Tony Hillerman's contribution is an unexpected piece: a somber study of death in which a killer goes to the gas chamber and a reporter struggles with words and deadlines. Elsewhere readers can take a break with a series of droll cartoons, attempt a cryptic word puzzle (not recommended for the dilettante crime lover) and sample other fine tales, from, among others, Scotland's Ian Rankin and California's Sue Grafton. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Digest Diet Cookbook</h2><p><b>Eat up and slim down with this companion to the phenomenally successful <i>The Digest Diet.</i><br> <br> </b>In <i>The Digest Diet</i>, Liz Vaccariello and the editors of <i>Reader's Digest</i> sifted through the latest weight-loss science to develop a groundbreaking 21-day eating plan demonstrated to help you drop the pounds.&nbsp; Real-life men and women who tried the plan--and lost up to 26 pounds!<br> <br> <b><i>The Digest Diet Cookbook</i></b> will give readers 150 all-new fat releasing recipes so they can branch out with new foods but still maintain their weight loss results.

Tracing the lives, loves, and aspirations of two couples who move between Vermont and Wisconsin, it is a work of quiet majesty, deep compassion, and powerful insight into the alchemy of friendship and marriage.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>It's deceptively simple: two bright young couples meet during the Depression and form an instant and lifelong friendship. "How do you make a book that anyone will read out of lives as quiet as these?" Larry Morgan, a successful novelist and the narrator of the story, poses that question many years after he and his wife, Sally, have befriended the vibrant, wealthy, and often troubled Sid and Charity Lang. "Where is the high life, the conspicuous waste, the violence, the kinky sex, the death wish?" It's not here. What <i>is</i> here is just as fascinating, just as compelling, as touching, and as tragic. <p> <i>Crossing to Safety</i> is about loyalty and survival in its most everyday form--the need to create bonds and the urge to tear them apart. Thirty-four years after their first meeting, when Larry and Sally are called back to the Langs' summer home in Vermont, it's as if for a final showdown. How has this friendship defined them? What is its legacy? Stegner offer answers in those small, perfectly rendered moments that make up lives "as quiet as these"--and as familiar as our own. <i>--Sara Nickerson</i></p>&#x201c;A superb book. . . .

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>There was a time when reading Joseph Heller's classic satire on the murderous insanity of war was nothing less than a rite of passage. Echoes of Yossarian, the wise-ass bombardier who was too smart to die but not smart enough to find a way out of his predicament, could be heard throughout the counterculture. As a result, it's impossible not to consider <i>Catch-22</i> to be something of a period piece. But 40 years on, the novel's undiminished strength is its looking-glass logic. Again and again, Heller's characters demonstrate that what is commonly held to be good, is bad; what is sensible, is nonsense. <p> Yossarian says, "You're talking about winning the war, and I am talking about winning the war and keeping alive." <br> "Exactly," Clevinger snapped smugly. "And which do you think is more important?" <br> "To whom?" Yossarian shot back. "It doesn't make a damn bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead." <br> "I can't think of another attitude that could be depended upon to give greater comfort to the enemy." <br> "The enemy," retorted Yossarian with weighted precision, "is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on." <br> Mirabile dictu, the book holds up post-Reagan, post-Gulf War. It's a good thing, too. As long as there's a military, that engine of lethal authority, <i>Catch-22</i> will shine as a handbook for smart-alecky pacifists. It's an utterly serious and sad, but damn funny book.</p>Joseph Heller was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1923. In 1961, he published Catch-22, which became a bestseller and, in 1970, a film. He went on to write such novels as Something Happened, God Knows, Picture This, Closing Time (the sequel to Catch-22), and Portrait of an Artist, as an Old Man. Heller died in December 1999.</p><h2>My Brother</h2><p>Jamaica Kincaid's incantatory, poetic, and often shockingly frank recounting of her brother Devon Drew's life is also the story of her family on the island of Antigua, a constellation centered on the powerful, sometimes threatening figure of the writer's mother. Kincaid's unblinking record of a life that ed too early speaks volumes about the difficult truths at the heart of all families.<br></p><p>Compassion only occasionally lightens the grim tone of Jamaica Kincaid's searing account of her younger brother Devon's 1996 death from AIDS. As in novels such as <i>Annie John</i>, Kincaid is ruthlessly honest about her ambivalence toward the impoverished Caribbean nation from which she fled, her restrictive family, and the culture that imprisoned Devon. That honesty, which includes chilling detachment from her brother's suffering, is sometimes alienating. But art has its own justifications. The bitter clarity of Kincaid's prose and the tangled, undeniably human feelings it lucidly dissects are justification enough.<b><i>Jamaica Kincaid's</i></b> books include <i>At the Bottom of the River</i>,<i> Annie John</i>, <i>A Small Place</i>, <i>Lucy</i>, and <i>The Autobiography of My Mother</i>.

In 1900, he published his best known book <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>.

One one side, the bottom of this hill just touches the Deadly Sandy Desert that separates the Fairyland of Oz from all the rest of the world, but on the other side, the hill touches the beautiful, fertile Country of the Munchkins.<br> <br>The Munchkin folks, however, merely stand off and look at Mount Munch and know very little about it; for, about a third of the way up, its sides become too steep to climb, and if any people live upon the top of that great towering peak that seems to reach nearly to the skies, the Munchkins are not aware of the fact.<br> <br>But people do live there, just the same. The top of Mount Munch is shaped like a saucer, broad and deep, and in the saucer are fields where grains and vegetables grow, and flocks are fed, and brooks flow and trees bear all sorts of things. There are houses scattered here and there, each having its family of Hyups, as the people call themselves. The Hyups seldom go down the mountain, for the same reason that the Munchkins never climb up: the sides are too steep.<br> <br>In one of the houses lived a wise old Hyup named Bini Aru, who used to be a clever Sorcerer. But Ozma of Oz, who rules everyone in the Land of Oz, had made a decree that no one should practice magic in her dominions except Glinda the Good and the Wizard of Oz, and when Glinda sent this royal command to the Hyups by means of a strong-winged Eagle, old Bini Aru at once stopped performing magical arts. He destroyed many of his magic powders and tools of magic, and afterward honestly obeyed the law. He had never seen Ozma, but he knew she was his Ruler and must be obeyed.<br> <br>There was only one thing that grieved him. He had discovered a new and secret method of transformations that was unknown to any other Sorcerer. Glinda the Good did not know it, nor did the little Wizard of Oz, nor Dr. Pipt nor old Mombi, nor anyone else who dealt in magic arts. It was Bini Aru&#x2019;s own secret. By its means, it was the simplest thing in the world to transform anyone into beast, bird or fish, or anything else, and back again, once you knew how to pronounce the mystical word: &#x201c;Pyrzqxgl.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bini Aru had used this secret many times, but not to cause evil or suffering to others. When he had wandered far from home and was hungry, he would say: &#x201c;I want to become a cow&#x2014;Pyrzqxgl!&#x201d; In an instant he would be a cow, and then he would eat grass and satisfy his hunger. All beasts and birds can talk in the Land of Oz, so when the cow was no longer hungry, it would say: &#x201c;I want to be Bini Aru again: Pyrzqxgl!&#x201d; and the magic word, properly pronounced, would instantly restore him to his proper form.<br> <br>Now, of course, I would not dare to write down this magic word so plainly if I thought my readers would pronounce it properly and so be able to transform themselves and others, but it is a fact that no one in all the world except Bini Aru, had ever (up to the time this story begins) been able to pronounce &#x201c;Pyrzqxgl!&#x201d; the right way, so I think it is safe to give it to you. It might be well, however, in reading this story aloud, to be careful not to pronounce Pyrzqxgl the proper way, and thus avoid all danger of the secret being able to work mischief.<br> <br>Bini Aru, having discovered the secret of instant transformation, which required no tools or powders or other chemicals or herbs and always worked perfectly, was reluctant to have such a wonderful discovery entirely unknown or lost to all human knowledge. He decided not to use it again, since Ozma had forbidden him to do so, but he reflected that Ozma was a girl and some time might change her mind and allow her subjects to practice magic, in which case Bini Aru could again transform himself and others at will,&#x2014;unless, of course, he forgot how to pronounce Pyrzqxgl in the meantime.<br> <br>After giving the matter careful thought, he decided to write the word, and how it should be pronounced, in some secret place, so that he could find it after many years, but where no one else could ever find it.<br> <br>That was a clever idea, but what bothered the old Sorcerer was to find a secret place. He wandered all over the Saucer at the top of Mount Munch, but found no place in which to write the secret word where others might not be likely to stumble upon it. So finally he decided it must be written somewhere in his own house.<br> <br>Bini Aru had a wife named Mopsi Aru who was famous for making fine huckleberry pies, and he had a son named Kiki Aru who was not famous at all. He was noted as being cross and disagreeable because he was not happy, and he was not happy because he wanted to go down the mountain and visit the big world below and his father would not let him. No one paid any attention to Kiki Aru, because he didn&#x2019;t amount to anything, anyway.<br> <br>Once a year there was a festival on Mount Munch which all the Hyups attended. It was held in the center of the saucer-shaped country, and the day was given over to feasting and merry-making. The young folks danced and sang songs; the women spread the tables with good things to eat, and the men played on musical instruments and told fairy tales.<br> <br>Kiki Aru usually went to these festivals with his parents, and then sat sullenly outside the circle and would not dance or sing or even talk to the other young people. So the festival did not make him any happier than other days, and this time he told Bini Aru and Mopsi Aru that he would not go. He would rather stay at home and be unhappy all by himself, he said, and so they gladly let him stay.<br> <br>But after he was left alone Kiki decided to enter his father&#x2019;s private room, where he was forbidden to go, and see if he could find any of the magic tools Bini Aru used to work with when he practiced sorcery. As he went in Kiki stubbed his toe on one of the floor boards. He searched everywhere but found no trace of his father&#x2019;s magic. All had been destroyed.<br> <br>Much disappointed, he started to go out again when he stubbed his toe on the same floor board. That set him thinking. Examining the board more closely, Kiki found it had been pried up and then nailed down again in such a manner that it was a little higher than the other boards. But why had his father taken up the board? Had he hidden some of his magic tools underneath the floor?<br> <br>Kiki got a chisel and pried up the board, but found nothing under it. He was just about to replace the board when it slipped from his hand and turned over, and he saw something written on the underside of it. The light was rather dim, so he took the board to the window and examined it, and found that the writing described exactly how to pronounce the magic word Pyrzqxgl, which would transform anyone into anything instantly, and back again when the word was repeated.<br> <br>Now, at first, Kiki Aru didn&#x2019;t realize what a wonderful secret he had discovered; but he thought it might be of use to him and so he took a piece of paper and made on it an exact copy of the instructions for pronouncing Pyrzqxgl. Then he folded the paper and put it in his pocket, and replaced the board in the floor so that no one would suspect it had been removed.<br> <br>After this Kiki went into the garden and sitting beneath a tree made a careful study of the paper. He had always wanted to get away from Mount Munch and visit the big world&#x2014;especially the Land of Oz&#x2014;and the idea now came to him that if he could transform himself into a bird, he could fly to any place he wished to go and fly back again whenever he cared to. It was necessary, however, to learn by heart the way to pronounce the magic word, because a bird would have no way to carry a paper with it, and Kiki would be unable to resume his proper shape if he forgot the word or its pronunciation.<br> <br>So he studied it a long time, repeating it a hundred times in his mind until he was sure he would not forget it. But to make safety doubly sure he placed the paper in a tin box in a neglected part of the garden and covered the box with small stones.<br> <br>By this time it was getting late in the day and Kiki wished to attempt his first transformation before his parents returned from the festival. So he stood on the front porch of his home and said:<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to become a big, strong bird, like a hawk&#x2014;Pyrzqxgl!&#x201d; He pronounced it the right way, so in a flash he felt that he was completely changed in form. He flapped his wings, hopped to the porch railing and said: &#x201c;Caw-oo! Caw-oo!&#x201d;<br> <br>Then he laughed and said half aloud: &#x201c;I suppose that&#x2019;s the funny sound this sort of a bird makes. But now let me try my wings and see if I&#x2019;m strong enough to fly across the desert.&#x201d;<br> <br>For he had decided to make his first trip to the country outside the Land of Oz. He had stolen this secret of transformation and he knew he had disobeyed the law of Oz by working magic. Perhaps Glinda or the Wizard of Oz would discover him and punish him, so it would be good policy to keep away from Oz altogether.<br> <br>Slowly Kiki rose into the air, and resting on his broad wings, floated in graceful circles above the saucer-shaped mountain-top. From his height, he could see, far across the burning sands of the Deadly Desert, another country that might be pleasant to explore, so he headed that way, and with strong, steady strokes of his wings, began the long flight.</p><h2>The Book Of Unknown Americans (Thorndike Press Large Print Core)</h2><p>Moving from Mexico to the United States when their daughter suffers a near-fatal accident, the Riveras confront cultural barriers, their daughter&#39;s difficult recovery, and her developing relationship with a Panamanian boy.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, June 2014:</strong> Cristina Henr�quez&#x2019;s powerful novel <em>The Book of Unknown Americans</em> captures readers with the quiet beauty of her characters and their profoundly wrought experiences as immigrants in America.

This book is the result of the author&#39;s six year quest to learn archery in the hands of Japanese Zen masters. It is an honest account of one man&#39;s journey to complete abandonment of &#39;the self&#39; and the Western principles that we use to define ourselves. Professor Herrigel imparts knowledge from his experiences and guides the reader through physical and spiritual lessons in a clear and insightful way. Mastering archery is not the key to achieving Zen, and this is not a practical guide to archery. It is more a guide to Zen principles and learning and perfect for practitioners and non-practitioners alike.</p><p>So many books have been written about the meditation side of Zen and the everyday, chop wood/carry water side of Zen. But few books have approached Zen the way that most Japanese actually do--through ritualized arts of discipline and beauty--and perhaps that is why Eugen Herrigel's <i>Zen in the Art of Archery</i> is still popular so long after it first publication in 1953. Herrigel, a philosophy professor, spent six years studying archery and flower-arranging in Japan, practicing every day, and struggling with foreign notions such as "eyes that hear and ears that see." In a short, pithy narrative, he brings the heart of Zen to perfect clarity--intuition, imitation, practice, practice, practice, then, boom, wondrous spontaneity fusing self and art, mind, body, and spirit. Herrigel writes with an attention to subtle profundity and relates it with a simple artistry that itself carries the signature of Zen. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Eugen Herrigel (1884-1955), a German professor who taught philosophy at the University of Tokyo, penetrated deeply and personally into the theory and practice of Zen Buddhism. In endeavoring to become a Zen mystic, he experienced the rigorous discipline of training with a Zen Master for six years. <br></p><h2>Deciphering the senses: The expanding world of human perception</h2><p>Reveals new scientific research that supports that there are more than the five classical senses.

He deliberately avoids a detailed chronology of every country and time period by emphasizing the most crucial events in shaping contemporary Europe. Fourteen focused chapters address such topical issues as the Enlightenment; the French Revolution and Napoleon; the Industrial Revolution; the theories and impact of Marx and Darwin; the revolutions of 1848, 1917, and 1989; the unifications of Germany and Italy; European imperialism; the two World Wars; the Cold War and decolonization; and the evolution and expansion of the European Union.

At heart it means to be entirely practical, as the "Science" of the name would indicate. Denying any interest in theology (there is no theology in the Bible, Fox argues), the author instead suggests that what Jesus was after was results: "Jesus explains to us what the nature of God is, and what our own nature is; tells us the meaning of life and of death; shows us why we make mistakes; why we yield to temptation; why we become sick, and impoverished, and old; and, most important of all, he tells us how all these evils may be overcome, and how we may bring health, happiness, and true prosperity into our lives."<p> And the Spiritual Key? Fox puts it quite simply: "The Truth turns out to be nothing less than the amazing but undeniable fact that the whole outer world--whether it be the physical body, the common things of life, the winds and the rain, the clouds, the earth itself--is amenable to man's thought, and that he has dominion over it when he knows it." <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p>What <i>did</i> Jesus teach? Distilled from years of study and lecture, affirmed by nearly a million readers over the last fifty years, Emmet Fox's answer in <i>The Sermon on the Mount</i> is simple. The Bible is a "textbook of metaphysics" and the teachings of Jesus express--without dogma--a practical approach for the development of the soul and for the shaping of our lives into what we really wish them to be. For Fox, Jesus was "no sentimental dreamer, no mere dealer in empty platitudes, but the unflinching realist that only a great mystic can be." <p>In his most popular work, Emmet Fox shows how to: Understand the true nature of divine wisdom. Tap into the power of prayer. Develop a completely integrated and fully expressed personality. Transform negative attitudes into life-affirming beliefs. Claim our divine right to the full abundance of life.</p></p><h2>Boy: Tales of Childhood</h2><p>Filled with excitement, humor, and the unexpected, this entertaining collection of tales--inspired by Roald Dahl&#39;s remarkable childhood--are stories that are not easily forgotten.</p><p><b>Roald Dahl</b>&nbsp;(1916-1990) was born in Wales of Norwegian parents.

His own father, my grandfather, was a fairly prosperous merchant who owned a store in Sarpsborg and traded in just about everything from cheese to chicken-wire.</p><p>I am writing these words in 1984, but this grandfather of mine was born, believe it or not, in 1820, shortly after Wellington had defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. If my grandfather had been alive today he would have been one hundred and sixty-four years old. My father would have been one hundred and twenty-one. Both my father and my grandfather were late starters so far as children were concerned.</p><p>When my father was fourteen, which is still more than one hundred years ago, he was up on the roof of the family house replacing some loose tiles when he slipped and fell. He broke his left arm below the elbow. Somebody ran to fetch the doctor, and half an hour later this gentleman made a majestic and drunken arrival in his horse-drawn buggy. He was so drunk that he mistook the fractured elbow for a dislocated shoulder.</p><p>&#x2018;We&#x2019;ll soon put this back into place!&#x2019; he cried out, and two men were called off the street to help with the pulling. They were instructed to hold my father by the waist while the doctor grabbed him by the wrist of the broken arm and shouted, &#x2018;Pull men, pull! Pull as hard as you can!&#x2019;</p><p>The pain must have been excruciating. The victim screamed, and his mother, who was watching the performance in horror, shouted &#x2018;Stop!&#x2019; But by then the pullers had done so much damage that a splinter of bone was sticking out through the skin of the forearm.</p><p>This was in 1877 and orthopaedic surgery was not what it is today. So they simply amputated the arm at the elbow, and for the rest of his life my father had to manage with one arm. Fortunately, it was the left arm that he lost and gradually, over the years, he taught himself to do more or less anything he wanted with just the four fingers and thumb of his right hand. He could tie a shoelace as quickly as you or me, and for cutting up the food on his plate, he sharpened the bottom edge of a fork so that it served as both knife and fork all in one. He kept his ingenious instrument in a slim leather case and carried it in his pocket wherever he went. The loss of an arm, he used to say, caused him only one serious inconvenience. He found it impossible to cut the top off a boiled egg.</p><p>My father was a year or so older than his brother Oscar, but they were exceptionally close, and soon after they left school, they went for a long walk together to plan their future. They decided that a small town like Sarpsborg in a small country like Norway was no place in which to make a fortune. So what they must do, they agreed, was go away to one of the big countries, either to England or France, where opportunities to make good would be boundless.</p><p>Their own father, an amiable giant nearly seven foot tall, lacked the drive and ambition of his sons, and he refused to support this tomfool idea. When he forbade them to go, they ran away from home, and somehow or other the two of them managed to work their way to France on a cargo ship.</p><p>From Calais they went to Paris, and in Paris they agreed to separate because each of them wished to be independent of the other. Uncle Oscar, for some reason, headed west for La Rochelle on the Atlantic coast, while my father remained in Paris for the time being.</p><p>The story of how these two brothers each started a totally separate business in different countries and how each of them made a fortune is interesting, but there is no time to tell it here except in the briefest manner.</p><p>Take my Uncle Oscar first. La Rochelle was then, and still is, a fishing port. By the time he was forty he had become the wealthiest man in town. He owned a fleet of trawlers called &#x2018;P�cheurs d&#x2019;Atlantique&#x2019; and a large canning factory to can the sardines his trawlers brought in. He acquired a wife from a good family and a magnificent town house as well as a large ch�teau in the country. He became a collector of Louis XV furniture, good pictures and rare books, and all these beautiful things together with the two properties are still in the family. I have not seen the ch�teau in the country, but I was in the La Rochelle house a couple of years ago and it really is something. The furniture alone should be in a museum.</p><p>While Uncle Oscar was bustling around in La Rochelle, his onearmed brother Harald (my own father) was not sitting on his rump doing nothing. He had met in Paris another young Norwegian called Aadnesen and the two of them now decided to form a partnership and become shipbrokers. A shipbroker is a person who supplies a ship with everything it needs when it comes into port &#x2013; fuel and food, ropes and paint, soap and towels, hammers and nails, and thousands of other tiddly little items. A shipbroker is a kind of enormous shopkeeper for ships, and by far the most important item he supplies to them is the fuel on which the ship&#x2019;s engines run. In those days fuel meant only one thing. It meant coal. There were no oil-burning motorships on the high seas at that time. All ships were steamships and these old steamers would take on hundreds and often thousands of tons of coal in one go. To the shipbrokers, coal was black gold.</p><p>My father and his new-found friend, Mr Aadnesen, understood all this very well. It made sense they told each other, to set up their shipbroking business in one of the great coaling ports of Europe. Which was it to be? The answer was simple. The greatest coaling port in the world at that time was Cardiff, in South Wales. So off to Cardiff they went, these two ambitious young men, carrying with them little or no luggage. But my father had something more delightful than luggage. He had a wife, a young French girl called Marie whom he had recently married in Paris.</p><p>In Cardiff, the shipbroking firm of &#x2018;Aadnesen &amp; Dahl&#x2019; was set up and a single room in Bute Street was rented as an office. From then on, we have what sounds like one of those exaggerated fairy-stories of success, but in reality it was the result of tremendous hard and brainy work by those two friends. Very soon &#x2018;Aadnesen &amp; Dahl&#x2019; had more business than the partners could handle alone. Larger office space was acquired and more staff were engaged. The real money then began rolling in. Within a few years, my father was able to buy a fine house in the village of Llandaff, just outside Cardiff, and there his wife Marie bore him two children, a girl and a boy. But tragically, she died after giving birth to the second child.</p><p>When the shock and sorrow of her death had begun to subside a little, my father suddenly realized that his two small children ought at the very least to have a stepmother to care for them. What is more, he felt terribly lonely. It was quite obvious that he must try to find himself another wife. But this was easier said than done for a Norwegian living in South Wales who didn&#x2019;t know very many people. So he decided to take a holiday and travel back to his own country, Norway, and who knows, he might if he was lucky find himself a lovely new bride in his own country.</p><p>Over in Norway, during the summer of 1911, while taking a trip in a small coastal steamer in the Oslofjord, he met a young lady called Sofie Magdalene Hesselberg. Being a fellow who knew a good thing when he saw one, he proposed to her within a week and married her soon after that.</p><p>Harald Dahl took his Norwegian wife on a honeymoon in Paris, and after that back to the house in Llandaff. The two of them were deeply in love and blissfully happy, and during the next six years she bore him four children, a girl, another girl, a boy (me) and a third girl. There were now six children in the family, two by my father&#x2019;s first wife and four by his second. A larger and grander house was needed and the money was there to buy it.</p><p>So in 1918, when I was two, we all moved into an imposing country mansion beside the village of Radyr, about eight miles west of Cardiff. I remember it as a mighty house with turrets on its roof and with majestic lawns and terraces all around it. There were many acres of farm and woodland, and a number of cottages for the staff. Very soon, the meadows were full of milking cows and the sties were full of pigs and the chicken-run was full of chickens. There were several massive shire-horses for pulling the ploughs and the hay-wagons, and there was a ploughman and a cowman and a couple of gardeners and all manner of servants in the house itself. Like his brother Oscar in La Rochelle, Harald Dahl had made it in no uncertain manner.</p><p>But what interests me most of all about these two brothers, Harald and Oscar, is this. Although they came from a simple unsophisticated small-town family, both of them, quite independently of one another, developed a powerful interest in beautiful things. As soon as they could afford it, they began to fill their houses with lovely paintings and fine furniture. In addition to that, my father became an expert gardener and above all a collector of alpine plants. My mother used to tell me how the two of them would go on expeditions up into the mountains of Norway and how he would frighten her to death by climbing one-handed up steep cliff-faces to reach small alpine plants growing high up on some rocky ledge. He was also an accomplished wood-carver, and most of the mirror-frames in the house were his own work. So indeed was the entire mantelpiece around the fireplace in the living-room, a splendid design of fruit and foliage and intertwining branches carved in oak.</p><p>He was a tremendous diary-writer. I still have one of his many notebooks from the Great War of 1914&#x2013;18. Every single day during those five war years he would write several pages of comment and observation about the events of the time. He wrote with a pen and although Norwegian was his mother-tongue, he always wrote his diaries in perfect English.</p><p>He harboured a curious theory about how to develop a sense of beauty in the minds of his children. Every time my mother became pregnant, he would wait until the last three months of her pregnancy and then he would announce to her that &#x2018;the glorious walks&#x2019; must begin. These glorious walks consisted of him taking her to places of great beauty in the countryside and walking with her for about an hour each day so that she could absorb the splendour of the surroundings. His theory was that if the eye of a pregnant woman was constantly observing the beauty of nature, this beauty would somehow become transmitted to the mind of the unborn baby within her womb and that baby would grow up to be a lover of beautiful things. This was the treatment that all of his children received before they were born.</p><p><i>Kindergarten, 1922&#x2013;3 (age 6&#x2013;7)</i></p><p>In 1920, when I was still only three, my mother&#x2019;s eldest child, my own sister Astri, died fro...</p></p><h2>Basic Wiring &amp; Electric Repair (Black &amp; Decker Home Improvement Library)</h2><p>Basic Wiring &amp; Electrical Repairs is a complete guide to fixing and maintaining your home's electrical system.

The late Christian mystic and seer Edgar Cayce emphasized the biblical view of the body as temple for the spirit. The task of sustaining the body, through good nutrition and other means, is therefore a spiritual responsibility. Cayce gave thousands of psychic readings addressing health and nutrition. Today, scientific research has validated many of the dietary recommendations proposed by Cayce, notably his consistent admonitions to substantially increase the intake of vegetables and fruits. Food fads come and go, but the Cayce diet stands the test of time as a sound, well-balanced nutrition plan which supplies all necessary nutrients in a form that is easily assimilated by the body. <i>Nourishing the Body Temple</i> provides a complete overview of the principles of healthy eating, synthesized from the Cayce readings by a professional nutritionist who explains them from the perspective of modern nutritional science. <br>Discussed are a wide range of topics, including enzymes, pH balance, vitamins, minerals, food combining, vegetarian diet, and medicinal foods. This book also gives you concise health information on topics such as: <br>* fruits, vegetables, and juicing<br>* raw food power<br>* seasonings, sweeteners, and beverages<br>* meat and dairy products<br>* fats and oils<br>* the special nutritional value of sea vegetables<br>* preserving nutrients in the cooking process<br>* power-boosting the immune system through an alkaline diet<br>* balancing weight naturally<br>A section of the book addresses the use of foods and supplements for nutritional needs during pregnancy and lactation, as well as for babies, young children, and teens.</p><p>Simone Gabbay, RNCP, is a holistic nutritionist, writer, and editor in Toronto, Canada.

The topics of the Cayce readings, as these discourses are called, range from metaphysical issues and spiritual development to earth change predictions and medical conditions. </p><p>More than half of the readings address health concerns and are based on natural therapies and remedies. Many of these have been successfully tried and tested by medical professionals and in clinical settings. Nutrition is considered to be an important link in Cayce's holistic approach to health care. </p><p>The following excerpt taken from <i>Nourishing the Body Temple</i> provides an explanation of Edgar Cayce's holistic approach to nutrition: </p><p>"In the Cayce readings, diet is featured prominently as both a preventative and a therapeutic measure. For nearly each ailment he was asked about, Cayce suggested dietary adjustments, along with other therapies and remedies. Although much of this nutritional advice was offered to individuals with differing biochemical constitutions and specific pathological conditions, there are many common elements which form the basis of what students of the readings have termed the Cayce diet. </p><p>The Cayce diet represents one of many links in the holistic philosophy of the readings. The word holistic is derived from the Greek holos, which translates into whole, or complete. Holistic healing recognizes and honors the essential unity of body, mind, and spirit, as well as the interrelationship between an individual's state of health and his or her environment. </p><p>The Cayce readings on diet and health clearly project this philosophy. As important as what we feed the body are the thoughts that we feed the mind. Reading 288-38 gives us the key to this important concept: "What we think and what we eat - combined together - make what we are, physically and mentally." The vibrational energy of the food interacts with the mental energy created by our thoughts, and they are both reactive to each other. Together, they create the aspect of our being that represents us in this lifetime upon the earth. With our intentions and actions, we choose to allow certain foods and thoughts to enter our bodies and minds, thereby continuously directing the re-creation of our mental and physical selves. Whether we realize it or not, we are cocreators with God, as Cayce tell us in reading 2246-1: "Thus is each soul, each entity, a cocreator with that universal consciousness ye call God." With this concept in mind, we can look upon diet as one of the tools available to us in this glorious act of cocreation."</p></p><h2>Hippocrates, Volume II: Prognostic (Loeb Classical Library, No. 148)</h2><p><p>Hippocrates, said to have been born in Cos in or before 460 BCE, learned medicine and philosophy; travelled widely as a medical doctor and teacher; was consulted by King Perdiccas of Macedon and Artaxerxes of Persia; and died perhaps at Larissa.

Thomas, <em>New York Observer</em></strong></p> Intimate, humorous, and insightful, Readings is a collection of classic essays and reviews by Michael Dirda, book critic of the <em>Washington Post</em> and winner of the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for criticism. From a first reading of Beckett and Faulkner at the feet of an inspirational high-school English teacher to a meeting of the P. G. Wodehouse Society, from an obsession with Nabokov's <em>Lolita</em> to the discovery of the Japanese epic <em>The Tale of Genji</em>, these essays chronicle a lifetime of literary enjoyment.</p><p>If you have never happened upon Michael's Dirda's "Readings" column in the <i>Washington Post Book World</i>, yours is a sorry fate indeed. One never knows what one will find there, except that it will come filtered through the witty, unpretentious, voracious, book-besotted being that is Michael Dirda. In one column, Dirda introduces Guy Davenport, "the best literary essayist since Randall Jarrell and Cyril Connolly"; just as ardently, he reports elsewhere on a weekend convention of the P.G. Wodehouse Society. Another column finds Dirda spatting with his spouse over the preferred fate of his children's outgrown books (she says get rid of them; he hides them in the garage). Yet another column--several, actually--find him fondling and justifying the purchase of some first edition or another. Dirda writes about books he has (sort of) stolen, teachers who mattered, and an early 11th century Japanese novel (Murasaki Shikubu's <i>The Tale of Genji</i>). He even discusses his secret desire not to read so many books. "I sometimes think that a passion for omnivorous reading has seduced me into a lifetime of one-night stands," he says, "while the less promiscuous have managed to find a single true and more fulfilling love." For our sake, Mr. Dirda, keep up those love affairs--that passion is contagious. Those many Dirda enthusiasms, presented here in a collection of 46 "Readings" columns, will ignite fires aplenty in the curious reader's mind. <i>--Jane Steinberg</i>Michael Dirda, who won a Pulitzer Prize for distinguished criticism at the&nbsp;Washington Post Book World, is the author of&nbsp;An Open Book,&nbsp;Bound to Please, and&nbsp;Readings: Essays and Literary Entertainments.

Includes recipes and appendix of classroom cooking directions.</p><p>Grade 3-6?Children are taken on a virtual tour of American cuisine as it was in Colonial times. The introduction grabs readers' attention as the author discusses foods that are commonly thought of as American, but that actually came from other countries. Each chapter deals with a different aspect of culinary matters, such as "Fireplace Cooking," "Preserving and Storing Food," "Soul Cooking," "Mannerly Eating," and "Feeding the Sweet Tooth." The book is written in a conversational tone and the author presents many facts that students will find fascinating. For example, they will learn that many Colonial women were killed when their dresses caught fire while they were cooking. The recipes include the modern cooking version as well as an explanation of how the Colonists actually made them. The colorful illustrations, most of which are done in panels of three along the sides of the pages, add interest.

Librarians will find themselves pulling this off the shelf for both teachers and students, as it introduces facts about America's culinary heritage that fit right into Thanksgiving celebrations and the study of the colonial period. Chapters cover such topics as manners, food preservation, and culinary staples such as corn. Ichord also includes a section on regional diversity and one she calls "Soul Cooking," which focuses on the unique cuisine created by slaves. Recipes for popular dishes, updated for modern kitchens and accompanied by clear directions and discussion of how the same dish would have been prepared by colonial cooks, conclude each chapter. Children will need adult help when they prepare the food, but they'll have fun learning the history and making such dishes as johnnycakes, pumpkin soup, and, of course, hasty pudding.

Give it time."<br><br>"Sleazy son-of-a-bitch," she muttered, turning away.<br><br>"I heard that," he said.<br><br>Nice profile, he thought. Attractive in that polished, cool-as-a-daiquiri way. Long legs, small bust, sculpted jaw, an angular, athletic look. Green eyes spiked with gray and a tousled, honey-blond bird's nest of hair. Ballsy and sexy, too. He'd never heard "sleazy son-of-a-bitch" sound so seductive.<br><br>"If you weren't so arrogant," he said, "I could teach you a few courtroom tricks."<br><br>"Save your breath for your inflatable doll."<br><br>"Cheap shot. That was a trial exhibit."<br><br>"Really? People have seen the doll in your car. Fully inflated."<br><br>"It rides shotgun so I can use the car-pool lane."<br><br>She walked toward the cell door. Shadows of the bars pin-striped her face. "I know your record, Solomon. I know all about you."<br><br>"If you've been stalking me, I'm gonna get a restraining order."<br><br>"You make a mockery of the law."<br><br>"I make up my own. Solomon's Laws. Rule Number One: 'When the law doesn't work, work the law.' "<br><br>"They should lock you up."<br><br>"Actually, they already have."<br><br>"You're a disgrace to the profession."<br><br>"Aw, c'mon. Where's your heart, Vickie?"<br><br>"<i>Victoria</i>! And I don't have one. I'm a prosecutor."<br><br>"I'll bet you think Jean Valjean belonged in prison."<br><br>"He stole the bread, didn't he?"<br><br>"You'd burn witches at the stake."<br><br>"Not until they exhausted all their appeals." She laughed, a sparkle of electricity.<br><br><i>Damn, she's good at this.</i><br><br>Fending off his <i>mishegoss</i>, trumping his insults with her own. Something else appealed to him, too. No wedding band and no engagement ring. Ms. Victoria Lord, rookie prosecutor, seemed to be unattached as well as argumentative. Maybe twenty-eight. Seven years younger than him.<br><br>"If you need any help around the courthouse," he said, "I'd be willing to mentor you."<br><br>"Is that what they're calling it these days?"<br><br><i>Touche</i>. But she'd said it with a smile. Maybe this wasn't so much combat as foreplay. Another parry, another thrust, who knows? The more he thought about it, the more confident he became.<br><br><i>She likes me. She really likes me.</i><br><i>I hate him.</i><br><br>I really hate him, Victoria decided.<br><br>Dammit, she'd been warned about Solomon. He always tested new prosecutors, baited them into losing their cool, lured them into mistrials. And she wasn't totally "new." She'd handled arraignments and preliminary hearings for eight months. And hadn't she won her first two felony trials? Of course, neither one had involved Steve Slash-and-Burn Solomon.<br><br>"You gotta know, the contempt citation is all your fault," he said from the facing cell.<br><br>She wouldn't give him the pleasure of saying, <i>Why</i>?<br><br>Or, <i>How</i>?<br><br>Or, <i>Go screw yourself</i>.<br><br>"You should never call opposing counsel a 'total fucking shark' in open court," he continued. "Save it for recess."<br><br>"You called <i>me </i>a 'persecutor.' "<br><br>"A slip of the tongue."<br><br>"You're incorrigible."<br><br>"Lose the big words. You'll confuse the jurors. Judges, too."<br><br>Victoria stopped pacing. It was stifling in the cell, and her feet were killing her. She wanted to pry off her ankle-strapped Prada pumps, but if she stood on this disgustingly sticky floor, she'd have to burn her panty hose. The plaid pencil skirt was uncomfortable, a tad too tight. Now she wished she'd taken the time to let it out before coming to court. Especially after catching Solomon, the pig, staring at her ass.<br><br>She saw him now, sprawled on the bench, hands behind his head, like a beach bum in a hammock. He had a dark shock of unruly hair, eyes filled with mischief, and a self-satisfied grin, like he'd just pinned a "Kick Me" note on her fanny. God, he was infuriating.<br><br>She couldn't wait to get back into the courtroom and convict his lowlife client. But just now, she felt exhausted. The adrenaline rush was ebbing, the lack of sleep was fogging her mind. All those hours practicing in front of the mirror.<br><br>"<i>Ladies and gentlemen, you will hear the testimony of Customs and Wildlife Officers </i>. . ."<br><br>Maybe she was going about this the wrong way. How many times had she had researched the legal issues, prepped her witnesses, rehearsed her opening statement?<br><br>". . . <i>who will testify that the defendant, Amancio Pedrosa, did unlawfully smuggle contraband, to wit, four parakeets, three parrots, two cockatoos</i> . . ."<br><br>And a partridge in a pear tree.<br><br>Maybe she'd burned herself out. Maybe that's why she'd cracked today. Had she looked ridiculous pushing a grocery cart overflowing with boxes to the prosecution table? There was Solomon, holding a single yellow pad, and there she was, weighted down with books, research folders, and color-coded index cards bristling with notes.<br><br>Even though she despised Solomon, she did envy his brash confidence. The way he glided across the courtroom, skating to the clerk's table, flashing an easy smile at the jurors. He was lean and wiry and graceful, comfortable in his own skin. When she rose to speak, she felt stiff and mechanical. All those eyes staring at her, judging her. Would she ever have his self-assurance?<br><br>An hour earlier, she hadn't even realized she was being held in contempt. Judge Gridley never used the word. He just formed a T with his hands and drawled, "Time-out, y'all. This ain't gonna look good on the instant replay." It was only then that she remembered that the judge was a part-time college football official.<br><br>"Mr. Solomon, you oughta know better," Judge Gridley continued. "Miss Lord, you're gonna have to learn. When I say that's enough bickering, that's by-God enough. No hitting after the whistle in my courtroom. Bailiff, show these two squabblers to our finest accommodations."<br><br>How humiliating. What would she say to her boss? She remembered Ray Pincher's "two strikes" orientation lecture: "If you're held in contempt, you'll feel blue. If it happens again, you'll be through."<br>But she wouldn't let it happen again. When they got back into the courtroom, she'd . . .<br><br><i>Shit!</i><br><br>Something was stuck on the velvet toe of her pump.<br><br><i>A sheet of toilet paper!</i><br><br>Grimacing, she scraped it off with the bottom of her other shoe. What else could go wrong?<br><br>"Hey, Lord, we're gonna be in here a while." That aggravating voice from the other cell. "So here are the ground rules. When one person has to pee, the other turns around."<br><br>She shot a look at the seatless, metal toilet bowl.<br><br><i>Right. As if I'd squat over that fondue pot of festering bacteria.</i><br><br>When she didn't respond, he said: "You still there or you bust out?" Somewhere, deep inside the walls, the plumbing groaned and water gurgled. "Suit yourself, but I gotta take a leak."<br><br>What a jerk.<br><br>Solomon was one of those men you run into in bars and gyms, she thought, so clueless as to believe they're both witty and charming.<br><br>"No peeking," he said.<br><br><i>There was a plague of these men, with a sizable percentage becoming lawyers.</i><br><br>"Unzipping now . . ."<br><br><i>Dear God, scrunch his scrotum, zipper his balls.</i><br><br>"Ahhh," he sighed, the <i>tinkle-tinkle</i> sounding like hailstones on a tin roof. "Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall," he sang out. "Ninety-nine bottles of beer . . ."<br><br>"I didn't realize they still made men like you," Victoria Lord said.<br>I'm getting through to her, Steve thought. Sure, she was still playing that old <i>I am strong, I am invincible, I am wo-man</i> shtick, but he sensed a shift in her mood.<br><br>There seemed to be something different about the feisty Ms. Lord. Nothing like the court stenographers he usually dated. Quiet, rather submissive women who transcribed whatever they heard. And nothing like the SoBe models, whose brains must have been fried by exposure to so many strobe lights.<br><br>He remembered looking around the courtroom when Victoria rose to address the judge. All the players--from his shifty client to the sleepy bailiff--had been riveted. Jurors, witnesses, cops, probation officers, jailers, clerks, public defenders. Hell, everybody watched <i>her,</i> even when <i>he</i> was talking. Yeah, she was a natural, with the kind of pizzazz they can't teach in law school.<br><br><i>Maybe the best rookie I've ever seen.</i><br><br>Of course, she had a rigid prosecutorial mentality, but he could work on that, once she forg...</p><h2>A Twist in the Tale</h2><p>The best-selling author presents a collection of twelve stories filled with the wit and the surprises for which he is known</p><p>JEFFREY ARCHER was educated at Oxford University.

As it turned out, all she had wanted to let me know was that she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to make it for what the French so decorously call a &#x201c;cind � sept.&#x201d; She had to visit her sister in Fulham who had been taken ill, she explained.<br>I was disappointed. It had been another depressing day, and now I was being asked to forgo the one thing that would have made it bearable.<br>&#x201c;I thought you didn&#x2019;t get on well with your sister,&#x201d; I said tartly.<br>There was no immediate reply from the other end. Eventually Carla asked, &#x201c;Shall we make it next Tuesday, the usual time?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if that&#x2019;s convenient,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you on Monday when I know what my plans are.&#x201d; I put down the receiver.<br>Wearily, I phoned my wife to let her know I was on the way home&#x2014;something I usually did from the phone box outside Carla&#x2019;s flat. It was a trick I often used to make Elizabeth feel she knew where I was every moment of the day.<br>Most of the office staff had already left for the night so I gathered together some papers I could work on at home. Since the new company had taken us over six months ago, the management had not only sacked my Number Two in the accounts department but expected me to cover his work as well as my own. I was hardly in a position to complain, since my new boss made it abundantly clear that if I didn&#x2019;t like the arrangement I should feel free to seek employment elsewhere. I might have, too, but I couldn&#x2019;t think of many firms that would readily take on a man who had reached that magic age somewhere between the sought after and the available.<br>As I drove out of the office car park and joined the evening rush hour I began to regret having been so sharp with Carla. After all, the role of the other woman was hardly one she delighted in. I began to feel guilty, so when I reached the corner of Sloane Square, I jumped out of my car and ran across the road.<br>&#x201c;A dozen roses,&#x201d; I said, fumbling with my wallet.<br>A man who must have made his profit from lovers selected twelve unopened buds without comment. My choice didn&#x2019;t show a great deal of imagination but at least Carla would know I&#x2019;d tried.<br>I drove on toward her flat, hoping she had not yet left for her sister&#x2019;s and that perhaps we might even find time for a quick drink. Then I remembered that I had already told my wife I was on the way home. A few minutes&#x2019; delay could be explained by a traffic jam, but that lame excuse could hardly cover my staying on for a drink.<br>When I arrived outside Carla&#x2019;s home I had the usual trouble finding a parking space, until I spotted a gap that would just take a Rover opposite the paper shop. I stopped and would have backed into the space had I not noticed a man coming out of the entrance to her block of flats. I wouldn&#x2019;t have given it a second thought if Carla hadn&#x2019;t followed him a moment later. She stood there in the doorway, wearing a loose blue housecoat. She leaned forward to give her departing visitor a kiss that could hardly have been described as sisterly. As she closed the door I drove my car round the corner and double-parked.<br>I watched the man in my rearview mirror as he crossed the road, went into the newsagent&#x2019;s and a few moments later reappeared with an evening paper and what looked like a packet of cigarettes. He walked to his car, a blue BMW, appeared to curse, and then removed a parking ticket from his windscreen. How long had the BMW been there? I even began to wonder if he had been with Carla when she phoned to tell me not to come round.<br>The man climbed into the BMW, fastened his seat belt and lit a cigarette before driving off. I took his parking meter space in part-payment for my woman. I didn&#x2019;t consider it a fair exchange. I checked up and down the street, as I always did, before getting out and walking over to the block of flats. It was already dark and no one gave me a second glance. I pressed the bell marked &#x201c;Moorland.&#x201d;<br>When Carla opened the front door I was greeted with a huge smile which quickly turned into a frown, then just as quickly back to a smile. The first smile must have been meant for the BMW man. I often wondered why she wouldn&#x2019;t give me a front door key. I stared into those blue eyes that had first captivated me so many months ago. Despite her smile, those eyes now revealed a coldness I had never seen before.<br>She turned to reopen the door and let me into her ground-floor flat. I noticed that under her housecoat she was wearing the wine-red negligee I had given her for Christmas. Once inside the flat I found myself checking round the room I knew so well. On the glass table in the center of the room stood the &#x201c;Snoopy&#x201d; coffee mug I usually drank from, empty. By its side was Carla&#x2019;s mug, also empty, and a dozen roses arranged in a vase. The buds were just beginning to open.<br>I have always been quick to chide and the sight of the flowers made it impossible for me to hide my anger.<br>&#x201c;And who was the man who just left?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;An insurance broker,&#x201d; she replied, quickly removing the mugs from the table.<br>&#x201c;And what was he insuring,&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Your love life?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why do you automatically assume he&#x2019;s my lover?&#x201d; she said, her voice rising.<br>&#x201c;Do you usually have coffee with an insurance broker in your negligee? Come to think of it, my negligee.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have coffee with whom I damn well please,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;and wearing what I damn well please, especially when you are on your way home to your wife.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But I had wanted to come to you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And then return to your wife. In any case you&#x2019;re always telling me I should lead my own life and not rely on you,&#x201d; she added, an argument Carla often fell back on when she had something to hide.<br>&#x201c;You know it&#x2019;s not that easy.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s easy enough for you to jump into bed with me whenever it suits you. That&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;m good for, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not fair.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not fair? Weren&#x2019;t you hoping for your usual at six so you could still be home at seven in time for supper with Elizabeth?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t made love to my wife in years!&#x201d; I shouted.<br>&#x201c;We only have your word for that,&#x201d; she spat out with scorn.<br>&#x201c;I have been utterly faithful to you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Which means I always have to be to you, I suppose?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Stop behaving like a whore.&#x201d;<br>Carla&#x2019;s eyes flashed as she leaped forward and slapped me across the face with all the strength she could muster.<br>I was still slightly off-balance when she raised her arm a second time, but as her hand came swinging toward me I blocked it and was even able to push her back against the mantelpiece. She recovered quickly and came flying back at me.<br>In a moment of uncontrolled fury, just as she was about to launch herself on me again, I clenched my fist and took a swing at her. I caught her on the side of the chin, and she wheeled back from the impact. I watched her put an arm out to break her fall, but before she had the chance to leap back up and retaliate, I turned and strode out, slamming the flat door behind me.<br>I ran down the hall, out onto the street, jumped into my car and drove off quickly. I couldn&#x2019;t have been with her for more than ten minutes. Although I felt like murdering her at the time, I regretted having hit her long before I reached home. Twice I nearly turned back. Everything she had complained about was fair and I wondered if I dared phone her once I had reached home.<br>If Elizabeth had intended to comment on my being late, she changed her mind the moment I handed her the roses. She began to arrange them in a vase while I poured myself a large whisky. I waited for her to say something as I rarely drank before dinner but she seemed preoccupied with the flowers. Although I had already made up my mind to phone Carla and try to make amends, I decided I couldn&#x2019;t do it from home. In any case, if I waited until the morning when I was back in the office, she might have calmed down a little.<br>I woke early the next day and lay in bed, considering what form my apology should take. I decided to invite her to lunch at that little French bistro she liked so much, halfway between my office and hers. Carla always appreciated being taken out in the middle of the day, when she knew it couldn&#x2019;t be just for sex. After I had shaved and dressed I joined Elizabeth for breakfast and seeing there was nothing interesting on the front page of the morning paper, I turned to the financial section. The company&#x2019;s shares had fallen again, following City forecasts of poor interim profits. Millions would undoubtedly be wiped off our quoted price following such a bad piece of publicity. I already knew that when it came to publishing the annual accounts it would be a miracle if the company didn&#x2019;t declare a loss.<br>After gulping down a second cup of coffee I kissed my wife on the cheek and made for the car. It was then that I decided to drop a note through Carla&#x2019;s letterbox rather than cope with the embarrassment of a phone call.<br>&#x201c;Forgive me,&#x201d; I wrote. &#x201c;Marcel&#x2019;s, one o&#x2019;clock.

Edwards Deming</i></p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Foreword</i></p><p>by W. Edwards Deming</p><p>Why is Western industry on the decline? Why has the balance of trade of the United States of America deteriorated year by year for twenty years? The deficit in export of manufactured goods is worse than the overall figures indicate, as export of agricultural products has been on the increase. We have people; we have natural resources, experience. Why the decline?</p><p>The cause of the decline is that management have walked off the job of management, striving instead for dividends and good performance of the price of the company&#x2019;s stock. A better way to serve stockholders would be to stay in business with constant improvement of quality of product and of service, thus to decrease costs, capture markets, provide jobs, and increase dividends.</p><p>In the decade after the War [the Second World War], the rest of the world was devastated. North America was the only source of manufactured products that the rest of the world needed. Almost any system of management will do well in a seller&#x2019;s market. Success in business in North America was confused with ability to manage.</p><p>Management in America (not all) have moved into what I call retroactive management: focus on the end-product&#x2014;look at reports on sales, inventory, quality in and quality out, the annual appraisal of people; start the statistical control of quality and QC-Circles for operations, unfortunately, detached from management&#x2019;s responsibility; apply management by the numbers, management by MBO. [Management By Objective], work standards.</p><p>The follies of the systems of management that thrived in the expanding market that followed the War are now all too obvious. They must now be blasted out, new construction commenced. Patchwork will not suffice.</p><p>Everyone doing his best is not the answer. Everyone <i>is</i> doing his best.

The applications, examples, and comments that she provides will be especially appreciated by her readers.</p><p>Washington</p><p>March 10, 1986</p><p><i>Preface</i></p><p>I first heard of W. Edwards Deming on a trip to Japan several years ago to research a story on workers at Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Inc., which had won contracts to build trolley and subway cars for the Philadelphia mass transit system. It never occurred to me at the time that the American who had taught the Japanese statistical quality control and principles of management after World War II was still living. Indeed, I supposed that he had died shortly after educating the Japanese. Otherwise, he would surely have been famous in this country as well.</p><p>I was therefore surprised to learn in 1984 that Dr. Deming was coming to town. He had been retained by the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce for a four-day seminar in March of that year. I was assigned by my employer, <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, to write a profile.</p><p>Dr. Deming was not only very much alive, but was in rare form when I met him for the first time on January 19, 1984. He was in Philadelphia that morning to give a speech in advance of his March booking, after which his schedule called for an immediate departure for San Diego. I was headed for San Diego as well, to take his seminar there as part of my research. His delightful and protective secretary, Cecelia (&#x201c;Cele&#x201d;) Kilian, had turned down my request to travel with him, and my flight left later than his.</p><p>After the Philadelphia speech, in which he soundly scolded his audience of executives for their poor management practices, Dr. Deming himself invited me to travel with him to San Diego. I quickly changed my plane reservation and off we went. He traveled with only a large briefcase and an inexpensive tan canvas shoulder bag. I remember watching him in the airport as he made a phone call, then pulled a train schedule from his pocket and nearsightedly consulted the pocket-size date book he lived by, jotting down arrangements for an engagement a year hence.</p><p>The Deming profile that appeared on March 11 in the newspaper&#x2019;s Sunday magazine, <i>Inquirer</i>, drew more response than any piece I&#x2019;d written in fifteen years of reporting. People wanted to know how to reach Dr. Deming, where to buy his book, how they could attend the seminar. We ran out of copies of the magazine article and then of reprints as well. When later I proposed doing a book on his method, Dr. Deming replied that he would help in any way he could.</p><p>Over the next year or so, I visited him on weekends at his Washington home near the Maryland line, treading the flagstone path that led past the big holly tree down to the basement entrance of his office. As he sat at his big blond desk, around the corner from the washer and dryer, he was surrounded by a lifetime of books, journals, curios, and awards. If time permitted after we talked&#x2014;or rather, after he talked and I listened&#x2014;there was lunch or dinner with him and sometimes with his wife, Lola, and other guests at his beloved Cosmos Club near Dupont Circle, where popovers and catfish were a specialty. Dr. Deming would order hazelnut ice cream all around, without even asking. Usually he piloted a stately white 1969 Lincoln Continental; its black seats exuded a rich leather smell. Once we took the bus. He was a fan of public transportation. &#x201c;I ride for twenty-five cents,&#x201d; he said with satisfaction in one of the few references he ever made to his advanced age. (During the course of researching the magazine article, I had inquired obliquely whether he was worried about who would carry on his work. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m all right,&#x201d; he answered tersely.) I found him in all respects to be a kind and thoughtful individual, if occasionally impatient at his student&#x2019;s failure to immediately grasp his conclusions.</p><p>Dr. Deming was good enough to read and comment on many chapters of this book, particularly on those dealing with the Fourteen Points and the Seven Deadly Diseases, and to make available the unpublished manuscript of his forthcoming book, <i>Out of the Crisis</i>. He also provided journals of his early trips to Japan. We traveled as well to several of his clients, and he supplied introductions to others.</p><p>The companies that had turned to Dr. Deming&#x2019;s method shared a sense not only of urgency and commitment but also of optimism and excitement. Suddenly, there was a new philosophy that promised answers where none had previously existed. Trained to gather and interpret data, their problem-solving teams were like detectives turned loose with a new sheaf of evidence. At last they had the ammunition to eliminate long-standing glitches in their processes, and they went after them with the enthusiasm of crime-stoppers. Show the slightest interest in their work, and out would come sheets of numbers and stories of misinterpreted clues and, finally, success. Probe a little more into the psyche of the employees, and their stories would bring tears to your eyes: what it meant to be taken seriously rather than to be treated with disdain. To be sought out for one&#x2019;s knowledge and to be asked to contribute to the future of a company. To <i>want</i> to go to work. I heard, too, from executives who had discovered how pleasant it is to share responsibility&#x2014;and to sleep better at night. How good it is to know their employees respect them. And to know that these feelings of satisfaction come at no cost to profits and productivity. Just the opposite&#x2014;their companies were doing better than ever before and saw no end to the improvement.</p><p>These ventures into the American workplace showed clearly that whether the product is hardware or service, whether the company employs two hundred or two hundred thousand, Americans still care about quality. The country is full of intelligent, courageous people who would change if they only knew how.</p><p>In Part Three, Making Deming Work, I sought to report from the factory floor&#x2014;or the office cubicle, as the case might be. I wanted to talk directly to the people involved in the change and to find out exactly what had taken place. I wanted to deal with specifics rather than generalities. Wherever I went, I found the same kinds of problems and the same human reactions. An executive who thinks his or her company is different from the ones in this book&#x2014;who says &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have those problems&#x201d; or &#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t happen here&#x201d;&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t really know what&#x2019;s going on, hasn&#x2019;t really talked to the company employees in an atmosphere free of fear.</p><p>By the same token, although evidence presented here of the Deming method&#x2019;s success is anecdotal in nature, to borrow a term from medical research, it would be a mistake to interpret it as atypical. The Deming method will work anywhere. It is universal.</p><p>The question arises, Is America ready? Must we continue the precipitous decline of our value-added economy, living on borrowed time and borrowed money and throwing up protectionist barriers, until we reach the cataclysmic state that more and more experts believe is inevitable? Must it be that only then our businesses and corporations will be prepared to accept a radically different style of management? Or can we act now?</p><p><i>Acknowledgments</i></p><p>Aside from those people whose contributions are evident in the writing, there were several whose keen understanding of the Deming method added significantly to my own. In this regard, I cannot thank the people of GOAL (Growth Opportunity Alliance of Greater Lawrence) enough for their generous help, particularly Director Bob King, for his suggestions, knowledge, and good humor, and statistician Diane Ritter, for holding my hand through histograms and control charts, and for her hospitality as well.</p><p>In Philadelphia, Mary Ann Gould was indispensable. So, too, was Brian Joiner, who gave of his time, insights, and considerable expertise during his trips to the city. At the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, I am grateful to Rick Ross for his encouragement and to Rosalie DiStasio for keeping me abreast of developments.</p><p>Friends helped beyond measure. I thank Peggy Anderson for guidance, Bob Schwabach and Don Drake for general support and expertise with word processors, and Beth Gillin, Jane Marie Glodek, Ellen Karasik, Ron Cole, Bill Eddins, Patsy McGlaughlin, and Jane Barr. For their interest and companionship during the long and vexing newspaper strike when this book was completed, I am grateful to my union colleagues Bill Barry, Kitty Caparella, Rick Tulsky, Lila Roisman, and others on the Newspaper Guild negotiating committee.</p><p>I am also grateful to David Boldt, editor of <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i> Sunday magazine, both for assigning the story that led to this book and for a happy, long-standing editor/writer relationship. All the people at the magazine, where I work, were a constant source of good cheer. Sally Downey, his assistant and my friend, was wonderful. My gratitude as well to Dr. Deming&#x2019;s devoted secretary, Cecelia Kilian, who put up with my many calls. Artist Carol Estornell gave both elegance and coherence to the illustrations in this book. Harold Tassell, Jim Naughton and Katherine Hatton gave important advice.</p><p>Finally, my love and thanks to my darling daughter, Sarah, for her patience and understanding; to my father, Joseph Vogel, to my stepmother, Lucia Yu, and to my mother, Mary Vogel, who did not fail me.</p><p><i>PART ONE</i></p><p>W. EDWARDS DEMING&#x2014;THE MAN AND HIS MISSION</p><p><i>Chapter 1</i></p><p>W. Edwards Deming:</p><p><i>A Biographical Note</i></p><p>Born on October 14, 1900, William Edwards Deming is as old as this century. He was sixteen when the United States entered World War I, and forty-one when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. He was in his fiftieth year when Japan, its economy staggering from the effects of war, decided it needed the help of a &#x201c;foreign expert,&#x201d; and he was in his eightieth when NBC featured him on a broadcast entitled &#x201c;If Japan Can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Why Can&#x2019;t We?&#x201d; and he was, at rather long last, discovered in his homeland.</p><p>He grew up on a Wyoming homestead during the period when irrigation was taming the Wild West and transport was by horse and buggy. His work has taken him to the frontiers of technology. Few have lived through so many important eras in history.</p><p>The son of a man who was trained in the law and a woman who studied music, he is named for them both: His father was William Albert Deming and his mother, Pluma Irene Edwards. From his father he derived a penchant for scholarship; from his mother, who had studied at Oberlin College&#x2019;s conservatory of music, a love of composition.</p><p>In the early 1900s, William Deming, Sr., moved his family from Sioux City, Iowa, to Cody, Wyoming, where he had a business arrangement with an attorney. He and Pluma had two small sons by that time, William and Robert, who was a year younger. Cody had been named for Buffalo Bill&#x2014;William Frederick Cody, the colorful nineteenth-century army scout and buffalo hunter and the organizer in 1883 of &#x201c;Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s Wild West Show.&#x201d; The Demings lived in a small house on the grounds of the Irma Hotel, named for Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s daughter, and Buffalo Bill himself would put in frequent appearances. The two boys were entranced by the long-haired, mustachioed blond showman. Robert Deming remembers visiting an aunt in Los Angeles when Buffalo Bill brought his show to town. The aunt and her two charges elbowed their way to the front of the crowd, and Buffalo Bill recognized the two boys from his home...</p></p><h2>Rockhounding Arizona (Rockhounding Series)</h2><p>Here are forests of petrified wood, veins of brilliant turquoise, and troves of facet-grade garnet, peridot, and amethyst-in all, more than 640 mineral species that make Arizona a rockhound&#39;s paradise.

Unquestionably his best-known creation is that of the jungle hero, Tarzan the Ape Man, but almost as well known are his stories of other planets beginning with the very popular Mars series. A torrent of novels followed: stories about Venus, tales of the Moon and of the middle Earth, westerns, and detective stories. In all, nearly one hundred stories bore Edgar Rice Burroughs' name.<br><br>Born in Chicago in 1875, he tried his hand at many businesses without notable success, until at the age of thirty-five, he turned to writing. With the publication of Tarzan of the Apes and A Princess of Mars, his career was assured. By the time of his death in 1950, at his home in a town bearing the name of his best known work, Tarzana, California over 40 million copies of Edgar Rice Burroughs books have appeared in 58 different languages.<b> <b>FOREWORD</b> <br> <b>TO THE READER OF THIS WORK:</b> </b> <br> <br>In submitting Captain Carter&#x2019;s strange manuscript to you in book form, I believe that a few words relative to this remarkable personality will be of interest.<br> <br>My first recollection of Captain Carter is of the few months he spent at my father&#x2019;s home in Virginia, just prior to the opening of the Civil War. I was then a child of but five years, yet I will remember the tall, dark, smooth-faced, athletic man whom I called Uncle Jack.<br> <br>He seemed always to be laughing; and he entered into the sports of the children with the same hearty good fellowship he displayed toward those pastimes in which the men and women of his own age indulged; or he would sit for an hour at a time entertaining my old grandmother with stories of his strange, wild life in all parts of the world. We all loved him, and our slaves fairly worshipped the ground he trod.<br> <br>He was a splendid specimen of manhood, standing a good two inches over six feet, broad of shoulder and narrow of hip, with the carriage of the trained fighting man. His features were regular and clear cut, his hair black and closely cropped, while his eyes were of a steel gray, reflecting a strong and loyal character, filled with fire and initiative. His manners were perfect, and his courtliness was that of a typical southern gentleman of the highest type.<br> <br>His horsemanship, especially after hounds, was a marvel and delight even in that country of magnificent horsemen. I have often heard my father caution him against his wild recklessness but he would only laugh, and say that the tumble that killed him would be from the back of a horse yet unfoaled.<br> <br>When the war broke out he left us, nor did I see him again for some fifteen or sixteen years. When he returned it was without warning, and I was much surprised to note that he had not aged apparently a moment, nor had he changed in any other outward way. He was, when others were with him, the same genial, happy fellow we had known of old, but when he thought himself alone I have seen him sit for hours gazing off into space, his face set in a look of wistful longing and hopeless misery; and at night he would sit thus looking up into the heavens, at what I did not know until I read his manuscript years afterwards.<br> <br>He told us that he had been prospecting and mining in Arizona part of the time since the war; and that he had been very successful was evidenced by the unlimited amount of money with which he was supplied. As to the details of his life during these years he was very reticent, in fact he would not talk of them at all.<br> <br>He remained with us for about a year and then went to New York, where he purchased a little place on the Hudson, where I visited him once a year on the occasions of my trips to the New York market&#x2014;my father and I owning and operating a string of general stores throughout Virginia at that time. Captain Carter had a small but beautiful cottage, situated on a bluff overlooking the river, and during one of my last visits, in the winter of 1885, I observed he was much occupied in writing, I presume now, upon this manuscript.<br> <br>He told me at this time that if anything should happen to him he wished me to take charge of his estate, and he gave me a key to a compartment in the safe which stood in his study, telling me I would find his will there and some personal instructions which he had me pledge myself to carry out with absolute fidelity.<br> <br>After I had retired for the night I have seen him from my window standing in the moonlight on the brink of the bluff overlooking the Hudson with his arms stretched out to the heavens as though in appeal. I thought at the time that he was praying, although I never had understood that he was in the strict sense of the term a religious man.<br> <br>Several months after I had returned home from my last visit, the first of March, 1886, I think, I received a telegram from him asking me to come to him at once. I had always been his favorite among the younger generation of Carters and so I hastened to comply with his demand.<br> <br>I arrived at the little station, about a mile from his grounds, on the morning of March 4, 1886, and when I asked the livery man to drive me out to Captain Carter&#x2019;s he replied that if I was a friend of the Captain&#x2019;s he had some very bad news for me; the Captain had been found dead shortly after daylight that very morning by the watchman attached to an adjoining property.<br> <br>For some reason this news did not surprise me, but I hurried out to his place as quickly as possible, so that I could take charge of the body and of his affairs.<br> <br>I found the watchman who had discovered him, together with the local police chief and several townspeople, assembled in his little study. The watchman related the few details connected with the finding of the body, which he said had been still warm when he came upon it. It lay, he said, stretched full length in the snow with the arms outstretched above the head toward the edge of the bluff, and when he showed me the spot it flashed upon me that it was the identical one where I had seen him on those other nights, with his arms raised in supplication to the skies.<br> <br>There were no marks of violence on the body, and with the aid of a local physician the coroner&#x2019;s jury quickly reached a decision of death from heart failure. Left alone in the study, I opened the safe and withdrew the contents of the drawer in which he had told me I would find my instructions. They were in part peculiar indeed, but I have followed them to each last detail as faithfully as I was able.<br> <br>He directed that I remove his body to Virginia without embalming, and that he be laid in an open coffin within a tomb which he previously had had constructed and which, as I later learned, was well ventilated. The instructions impressed upon me that I must personally see that this was carried out just as he directed, even in secrecy if necessary.<br> <br>His property was left in such a way that I was to receive the entire income for twenty-five years, when the principal was to become mine. His further instructions related to this manuscript which I was to retain sealed and unread, just as I found it, for eleven years; nor was I to divulge its contents until twenty-one years after his death.<br> <br>A strange feature about the tomb, where his body still lies, is that the massive door is equipped with a single, huge gold-plated spring lock which can be opened <i>only from the inside</i>.<br> <br>Yours very sincerely,<br> <br>Edgar Rice Burroughs<br> <br>� 2012 Simon &amp; Schuster</p><h2>Slice &amp; Bake Cookies: Fast Recipes from your Refrigerator or Freezer</h2><p>For those short on time but long on cookie love, <em>Slice &amp; Bake Cookies</em> comes to the rescue!

The granddaddy of them all was probably the lowly crab apple of the Caucasus. In ancient times the apple was often confused with the quince or the pomegranate but by Greek and Roman days it was carefully cultivated in orchards and had attained an important place in mythology. As the fruit of love it was dear to Aphrodite and sacred to the sun god, Apollo. Apples frequently figured in lovers&#39; trysts. But as far as that apple in the Garden of Eden goes, it was apocryphal, probably dating from the 15th century. From folklore and mythology Wynne turns to examining the more popular varieties cultivated in the U.S. today. He grades twenty according to color, texture (including those best suited for cooking) and taste. And if your local market sells only Golden Delicious and McIntosh, you are being cheated of some of the very best. In conclusion Wynne provides recipes, most adapted from cookbooks dating back as far as the 15th century. And you might set the kids to bobbing for apples next Halloween.

"Little Skag" Farino, the last don of the local crime family, wants Kurtz dead and is sending in platoons of hit men, starting with the Attica Three Stooges and working up through more competent killers. Little Skag's beautiful sister, Angelina Farino Ferrara, is back from seven years in Sicily and has her own deadly agenda for Kurtz. <br><br>If that isn't enough, Kurtz is approached by a dying concert violinist who wants his daughter's killer found. Rejecting the case at first, he is soon on the trail of a man who's not just the murderer of one child, but a cold-blooded serial killer who is a master of alternate identities and has the power to send a hundred men after Kurtz. As the bodies pile up like cords of wood, Hard Freeze hits town with the power of a whiteout blizzard and builds to a truly chilling climax. This is a crime novel where trigger fingers freeze to blue steel. <br></p><p>Having proven he can write hard-nosed noir with 2001's <i>Hardcase</i>, prolific genre-crossing author Dan Simmons reintroduces his gritty protagonist Joe Kurtz and promptly pitches him into the icy waters of <i>Hard Freeze</i>. Two pages into the book, the ex-private investigator is just minding his business on the frozen streets of Buffalo and already he's got a contract on his head. As Kurtz says, "It was shaping up to be an especially tough winter." When he finds out who the money behind the hit is, Joe's already outgunned and outmanned but never outsmarted. This wily warrior is always one step ahead of whoever is chasing him, be they crooked cops, calculating serial killers, corpulent mob bosses, or not-so-distressed damsels. <p> Simmons has crafted a perfectly ruthless crime novel with a relentless pace that doesn't let up until the final page. The single-minded Joe Kurtz is a wonderfully flawed and deliciously soiled noir icon. He's smart, salty, literate, smushy in all the right places, and not somebody to cross. In all, <i>Hard Freeze</i> is a fast-paced thriller that successfully interweaves amazingly disparate plot threads in an explosive--really explosive--climax. <i>--Jeremy Pugh</i></p>Oustanding Praise for Dan Simmons' Novels<br><br><i>Hard Freeze</i><br>"<i>Hard Freeze</i> makes for great escapist reading...get ready to dip into a terrific, take-no-prisoners read."-<i>The Denver Post</i><br><br>"Readers looking for two-fisted, take-no-prisoners action should pick up a copy."<br>--<i>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</i><br> <br>"A bristling climax...Kurtz makes a riveting protagonist for the noir-is-beautiful crowd."<br>--<i>Kirkus Review</i> (starred review) <br><br>"In addition to crafting one of the least likeable protagonists you'll ever find yourself rooting for...

WREDE has written many novels, including Sorcery and Cecelia or The Enchanted Chocolate Pot and The Grand Tour coauthored with Caroline Stevermer, as well as the four books in her own series, the Enchanted Forest Chronicles. She lives near Minneapolis, Minnesota.A collection of magical short stories by an author best known for her humorous Enchanted Forest Chronicles, in which spunky young heroines turn the knight-in-shining-armordamsel-in-distress paradigm on its head. Though mostly unrelated to the novels, stories such as ``The Princess, the Cat, and the Unicorn'' and ``The Sixty-two Curses of Caliph Arenschadd'' carry on the unconventional princess theme. The last story in particular, ``Utensile Strength,'' involves familiar characters from Wrede's series and features a rousing ``bake-off'' for knights, with the recipe for the winning entry included. Other pieces dig deeper into the eerie world of magic and the imagination. ``Stronger than Time'' is a wonderfully spooky Sleeping Beauty story, and ``Cruel Sisters'' imagines the complex psychological relationships behind the lyrics of an old song, in which a magic harp sings of one sister's drowning another. ``Roses by Moonlight'' examines human nature and, along with ``The Lorelei,'' starts off with a contemporary setting that intersects with the ancient world of magic.

But how can parents teach these crucial lessons in ways that are entertaining, meaningful, and respectful? What happens if they can't remember all the lessons and important historical events? This <i>Family Treasury of Jewish Holidays</i> offers some solutions to these quandaries. For instance, by reading the compelling Hebrew stories and poems aloud, parents help children learn through the realm imagination--the place where characters, images, and ancient lessons come alive. "Listening to a riveting story will build anticipation for a holiday, encourage a wish for a Jewish life, and create sweet memories of reading together," offers Malka Drucker in her introduction. The treasury also includes numerous poems, holiday crafts, recipes, and family activities. This is an excellent gift and keepsake for any Jewish household with young children. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Malka Drucker is the author of more than 20 books for adults and children, including several about Jewish traditions.

That is how several distinguished professors of religion at Brigham Young University and teachers at seminaries and institutes have described A Companion to Your Study of the Book of Mormon. The purpose of this important volume is to provide pertinent information on the coming forth of this standard work as well as supplementary information on some of its important and more difficult passages. The commentary on these passages comes from the teachings of General Authorities, from the writings of Book of Mormon scholars, and from the observations and experiences of the author, a professor of religion at BYU and director of Correlation Review for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Teachers, students, and all who wish to gain greater insight into the understanding of the Book of Mormon.</p><p></p><h2>Voyage to Alpha Centauri: A Novel</h2><p><p>Set eighty years in the future, this novel by the best-selling author Michael D. O'Brien is about an expedition sent from the planet Earth to Alpha Centauri, the star closest to our solar system. The <i>Kosmos</i>, a great ship that the central character Neil de Hoyos describes as a "flying city", is immense in size and capable of more than half light-speed. Hoyos is a Nobel Prize winning physicist who has played a major role in designing the ship.</p><p>Hoyos has signed on as a passenger because he desires to escape the seemingly benign totalitarian government that controls everything on his home planet. He is a skeptical and quirky misanthropic humanist with old tragedies, loves, and hatreds that are secreted in his memory. The surprises that await him on the voyage-and its destination-will shatter all of his assumptions and point him to a true new horizon.</p><p>Science fiction and fantasy literature are genres that have become dominant forces in contemporary worldwide culture. Our fascination with the near-angelic powers of new technology, its benefits and dangers, its potential for obsession and catastrophe, raises vital questions that this work explores about human nature and the cosmos, about man's image of himself and where he is going-and why he seeks to go there.</p></p><p>Michael O'Brien, iconographer, painter, and writer, is the popular author of many best-selling novels including <i>Father Elijah</i>, <i>The Father's Tale</i>, <i>Eclipse of the Sun</i>, <i>Sophia House</i>, , and <i>Island of the World</i>. His novels have been translated into twelve languages and widely reviewed in both secular and religious media in North America and Europe. He lives in Ontario with his wife, Sheila, and family."Michael O'Brien is a superior spiritual story teller worthy to join the ranks of C.S. Lewis, Flannery O'Connor, Graham Greene, and Evelyn Waugh." --<b>Peter Kreeft, Ph.D.</b>, Boston College<br><br>Some Sci Fi novels are scientism fiction, worshiping science. Others are science friction, where high tech makes humans lowly. <i>Voyage to Alpha Centauri</i>, though, neither creates a new god nor blames science for our sin. Its narrator excitedly embarks on a 19-year trip aboard a sleek, huge spaceship, only to learn of oppression in the heavens as on earth, with big brothers watching and demanding lying conformity. Michael O'Brien shows us the battle that ensues and its sensational result as he skillfully portrays a clash of world views without end, amen. --<b>Marvin Olasky</b>, Editor-in-chief, World Magazine<br><br>Ingenious, expansive, and enduringly wise, <i>Voyage to Alpha Centauri</i> is a tour de force of storytelling and moral imagination--sparkling in its humanity, rich in its embroidery, and chilling in its plausibility. It is a parable of an age that could easily become our own, with its concomitant wonders and dangers, an exploration of the most sublime heights and of the greatest depths of human possibility, and a thought-provoking meditation on the ethical limits of knowledge. In <i>Voyage to Alpha Centauri</i>, Michael O'Brien has given us a literary treasure and a deeply satisfying read. --<b>Corban Addison</b>, Author, <i>A Walk Across the Sun</i></p><h2>My Math, Vol. 1: Grade 4, Teacher Edition</h2><p>Almost brand new.

As the author of this inspirational true story, Albom uses verbal inflection in exactly the right places to evoke humor, empathy, and emotion. It's an honest reading, and the underlying timbre of private memory pushes it past mere recitation to pure storytelling.<p> The titular Morrie was Morrie Schwartz, Albom's university professor 20 years before the events being narrated. An accidental viewing of an interview with Morrie on <i>Nightline</i> led Albom to become reunited with his old teacher, friend, and "coach" at a time when Albom, a successful sportswriter, was struggling to define dissatisfactions with his own life and career. Morrie, on the other hand, after a rich life filled with friends, family, teaching, and music, was dying from Lou Gehrig's disease, a crippling illness that diminished his activities daily. Albom was one of hundreds of former students and acquaintances who traveled great distances to visit Morrie in the final months of his life.</p><p> The 14 Tuesday visits that followed their reunion took Albom--and will take listeners with him--on a journey of reawakening to life's best rewards. The story is told in a journalistic style that never crosses into pathos. That a professional writer can write well is not surprising, but Albom also reads well, with clear enunciation and a talent for mimicry. Another reader might have interpreted the professor's aphorisms as droll humor or wrung a wrong note at an inappropriate moment, making the story a maudlin tearjerker; instead it is read for what it is, a tribute to a remarkable teacher.

He&#39;s antagonized almost everyone at the top in Tinseltown. And now, Joe Eszterhas tells everything he knows -- in brief, quotable bursts -- about the business, the history of Hollywood, and how to write screenplays that make millions. Idiosyncratic, gruff and as shaggy as Eszterhas himself, The Devil&#39;s Guide to Hollywood makes a character/leitmotif of Eszterhas&#39; fellow Hungarian Zsa Zsa Gabor (&#34;Money is like a sixth sense that makes it possible for you to fully enjoy the other five.&#34;), and makes the case that Marilyn Monroe was the sharpest tack in Hollywood (&#34;Hollywood is a place where they&#39;ll pay you a thousand dollars for a kiss and fifty cents for your soul. I know, because I turned down the first offer often enough and held out for the fifty cents.&#34;).

He also recounts bite-sized takes from personalities he either admires or loathes, sharing the richest, best industry lore that has inspired, amused or enraged him over the years.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Devil&#x2019;s Guide to Hollywood</i> is hilarious, ornery, colorful and wise.

Which flowers attract butterflies? Why do hummingbirds fly toward the color red? What's the role of water in attracting these revelatory creatures across the garden's boundary? The book opens with a chapter called "The Basics," which explains where and when hummingbirds and butterflies tend to emerge and their migration patterns, climate preferences, and life cycles. Later chapters include "Tempting Butterflies with Treats" and "Butterfly and Hummingbird Garden Designs." It concludes with a series of clear drawings of various species and their identifying characteristics, favored plants, range, and habitat. Writer Sally Roth is a natural guide to this flying world, and although her text contains reams of information, it never seems complicated or overwhelming. Well organized with illuminating sidebars and remarkable close-up photographs--a mother hummer feeding her young in their tiny nest--<i>Attracting Butterflies and Hummingbirds to Your Backyard</i> will help you turn your garden into a destination for these miraculous guests. <i>--Emily White</i>A lifelong naturalist and gardener, Sally Roth is the author of the highly successful <i>The Backyard Birdfeeder's Bible</i> and <i>Attracting Birds to Your Backyard</i>.

It is a place of intoxicating ambition, passion, art, and discontent, where louche jazz venues like the Chameleon Club draw expats, artists, libertines, and parvenus looking to indulge their true selves. It is at the Chameleon where the striking Lou Villars, an extraordinary athlete and scandalous cross-dressing lesbian, finds refuge among the club&#x2019;s loyal denizens, including the rising Hungarian photographer Gabor Tsenyi, the socialite and art patron Baroness Lily de Rossignol; and the caustic American writer Lionel Maine.</p><p>As the years pass, their fortunes&#x2014;and the world itself&#x2014;evolve. Lou falls desperately in love and finds success as a race car driver.

As the exuberant twenties give way to darker times, Lou experiences another metamorphosis&#x2014;sparked by tumultuous events&#x2014;that will warp her earnest desire for love and approval into something far more.</p></p><p>Francine Prose <p><b></b></p> <b>Francine Prose Explains the Genesis of Lovers at the Chameleon Club, Paris 1932</b> <p></p> <p>Lovers at the Chameleon Club, Paris 1932 began with a Brassai photograph I saw at a museum show in Washington. I was familiar with the photo, &#x201c;Lesbian Couple at Le Monocle, 1932&#x201d;: a portrait of two women sitting at a table in a bar, one in a sparkly evening gown, the other in drag, with short hair and a tuxedo. But the wall text said something I hadn&#x2019;t known, which was that the woman in the tuxedo, a professional athlete named Violette Morris, had worked for the Gestapo during the German occupation of Paris and later been assassinated by the French Resistance. </p> <p>A little research turned up an even more interesting story. Morris was an Olympic hopeful and a professional auto racer. When her license to compete as an athlete was revoked by the French government, as punishment for being a public cross-dresser, Hitler somehow got wind of it, and invited Morris to be his special guest at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. By the time she got back to France, she was not only spying for the Germans, but she was the person who told them where the Maginot Line ended: where they could breach the French defenses. During the Occupation, she did indeed work for the Nazis, and was killed by the Resistance in 1944. </p> <p>It was such an amazing story that I considered writing it as nonfiction, but I soon decided that I would have more liberty, and that I and my readers would have a lot more fun, if I wrote it as a novel. As the process went on, the novel became less linear, and about all sorts of things besides Violette Morris (in the novel named Lou Villars). Moving back twenty years from the date of her death, I found myself writing about Paris in the &#x2018;20s, and using several different voices. Gabor, the photographer, is writing letters home to his parents in Hungary, as did Brassai. An American, Lionel Maine, is writing a novel/memoir about expatriate life, a little like Henry Miller. There are several other faux-memoirs, some &#x201c;published,&#x201d; some not, one by a baroness, one by Gabor&#x2019;s wife. And Lou&#x2019;s story comes to us in the form of a life history by her &#x201c;biographer,&#x201d; Nathalie Dunois, a teacher at a regional high school, who cannot seem to separate her own life and her own problems from her subject&#x2019;s. Hitler and Picasso make cameo appearances. </p> <p>Each person has his or her version of the truth about the bright and glorious days of Paris in the &#x2018;20s, the theatrical spectacle and intrigue of Berlin in the &#x2018;30s, and the darker era that began when those two worlds came together. As always, the novel ended in a very different place from where it began. I started off writing about a woman in a tuxedo and wound up writing about art, love, evil, money, auto racing, espionage, insomnia, seduction and betrayal&#x2014;and the way that history changes, depending on who tells it.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <br> <p><b></b></p> <p></p><p><em>A richly imagined and stunningly inventive literary masterpiece of love, art, and betrayal, exploring the genesis of evil, the unforeseen consequences of love, and the ultimate unreliability of storytelling itself</em></p><p>Paris in the 1920s.

Explaining the history, science, and basic processes of preserving, Pam Corbin guides us through a world of jams, jellies, butters, curds, pickles, chutneys, cordials, liqueurs, vinegars, and sauces that can be made from local produce throughout the year. She includes 75 recipes, covering everything from traditional favorites such as raspberry jam, lemon curd, quince cheese, and sloe gin, to fresh new combinations such as apple butter, cucumber pickle, and nettle pesto.

Pharaohs and Kings unveils the historical reality of such biblical personalities as Moses, David, and Solomon, and such archaeological wonders as the desecrated statue of Joseph in his coat of many colors. Basis of a series on The Learning Channel in January 1996. Photos.</p><p>David Rohl is currently Chairman of the Institute for the Study of Interdisciplinary Sciences.British Egyptologist Rohl has produced a sumptuous popular summary of his ten-year "search for historical truth." Claiming no religious presuppositions, he has made a strong defense of the historicity of the Hebrew Bible by radically revising the traditional Egyptian chronology from the Middle Kingdom until the sacking of Thebes in 664 B.C. His "new chronology," combined with his new identifications of a few pharaohs encountered by the Hebrews, leads to the correlation of Saul and David with the Amarna period of Pharaoh Akhenaton and the dating of the Exodus to the reign of Rameses II. The new Exodus date produces a close correlation to the cultural conditions and destruction levels in Palestine. This is an excellent introduction to a topic that will surely be debated in the scholarly literature. Including end notes and an extensive bibliography for the reader who can handle the literature, the book is enhanced by exceptionally clear, helpful black-and-white photos; three groupings of color plates; numerous clear maps, charts, and diagrams; and an excellent glossary.

Based on a true story.</p><p>Hernan Sosa's sensitive and detailed watercolor and ink illustrations reveal much about life in the colonia, a neighborhood bordering a towering trash heap, as he brings to life Armando's thin mattress on cinder blocks, his few treasures on a makeshift shelf, and the candle by his bedside for light. . . . With a liberal sprinkling of Spanish words and phrases, authors Fine and Josephson tackle some powerful themes of social justice and equal opportunity, but the story is not heavy-handed or preachy. Armando's story is likely to prompt children of all ages to think hard about the gifts and privileges in their own lives. . . . This book about a blue tarp school teaches a valuable lesson about hope, possibilities and the power of one person to make a difference in a community. -- <i>PaperTigers.org</i><br><br>The authors do an excellent job communicating the difficult living conditions of the most vulnerable of the poor-children who work rather than go to school and live in shacks alongside the dump. . . . This book makes a tremendous addition to any collection of children's literature that focuses on high quality content. With its developing country setting and the story of the real Se�or David Lynch at the back, the book is as realistic as it is inspiring. -- <i>The Rutgers University Project on Economics and Children</i><br><br>This affecting tale--of a plein-air schoolroom in a deeply impoverished neighborhood populated by pepenadores (trash pickers)--springs from the real deal. Fine and Josephson have taken the story of David Lynch, who first went to Mexico in 1980 to teach children living in the Tijuana city dump, and fashioned it into a picture book. Fictional, yes, but only marginally so. Their story pivots around Armando, who scours the dump with his father all day long for anything of worth, and his thirst to join the classroom: a blue tarp on the bare ground. Though Armando's income is vital to the family, his parents come to understand that only an education will allow him to eclipse pepenadore life. The simplicity of the story is what lets it run deep, its bite of realism; no sermons are being delivered here, just a door thrown open to life under reduced circumstances (though Sosa's artwork, with its look of leaded glass, conveys a benevolent quality to the proceedings). Without patronizing, Se�or David defines the essence of humanitarianism, while the pepenadores, ever searching for beauty in the beast, find gold--and prize it. -- <i>KIRKUS REVIEWS</i><br><br>Armando and his family live in a colonia near the Tiajuana city dump. Like most of their neighbors, they eke out a meager living by hunting through the mounds of foul-smelling garbage for anything they can use or sell. Then Se�or David arrives, spreads a blue tarp on the ground, and sets up a school. At first the boy's parents are reluctant to let him attend because they need him to work for the family, but eventually they realize that this school could lead to a better life for their son. An extensive author's note explains that Se�or David is based on David Lynch, a former special-education teacher who has devoted 27 years to teaching children like Armando in a similar colonia. The well-written text will be an eye-opener for children who take school for granted. -- <i>SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL</i><br><br>This poignant picture book narrated by a young boy is based on a true story of a New York City teacher who set up a school on a blue tarp spread on the ground near a garbage dump in Tijuana, Mexico. Armando works all day with his father in the foul-smelling dump, picking through trash, "some to sell, some to use." He begs his parents to let him go to the blue tarp school, and at last, his parents allow him to attend in the afternoons. Clear, unframed, double-page pictures in watercolor and ink with thick white outlines show the children on the tarp in the midst of the noisy colonia (neighborhood) and also the bond between the boy and his teacher. When a huge fire burns the neighborhood, Armando's picture of the fiery night is printed alongside the story in the newspaper, and people send money to build a real schoolhouse. A lengthy final note fills in the facts and includes photos of the teacher and the pupils at the school now. Without melodrama, Armando's story shows what poverty means and the hope that things can change. -- <i>BOOKLIST</i></p><h2>Pilots Choice Liaden Universe Adventures</h2><p>Lee and Miller mix a compelling fictional society governed by a strict code of honor with romantic, funny, touchingly real characters and great storytelling in &#34;Pilots Choice&#34;.

Long greatly prized as the court dogs of the Chinese emperors, they were almost unknown in the West until the 19th C. and their introduction coincided with the reigns of two remarkable women: on one hand, the Dowager Empress of China, Tzu-hsi, one of the most fascinating..and perhaps wicked..women in history; on the other, Victoria, the young British monarch who was to see her empire grow to rival that of the Chinese. <br><br>Rumer Godden takes these two very different women and their courts..the Summer Palace and the Winter Castle..and around their lives and times weaves a history of the 'golden-coated nimble dogs, 'as Marco Polo described them.<br><br>The pekingese were so important in Chinese court and religious life that they recur repeatedly in the decorative arts, in scrolls, ornaments and painting,s and in the legends and literature of China. here Godden has assembled a beautiful collection of illustrations to show the role and evolution of the pekingese down the ages.

How do they resemble and how do they differ from Jews in other places and times? What have their relationships been to the cultures of their neighbors? To address these and similar questions, some of the finest scholars of our day have contributed their insights to <i>Cultures of the Jews</i>, a winner of the National Jewish Book Award upon its hardcover publication in 2002. <br><br>Constructing their essays around specific cultural artifacts that were created in the period and locale under study, the contributors describe the cultural interactions among different Jews&#x2013;from rabbis and scholars to non-elite groups, including women&#x2013;as well as between Jews and the surrounding non-Jewish world. What they conclude is that although Jews have always had their own autonomous traditions, Jewish identity cannot be considered the fixed product of either ancient ethnic or religious origins. Rather, it has shifted and assumed new forms in response to the cultural environment in which the Jews have lived.<br><br><i>Diversities of Diaspora</i>, the second volume in <i>Cultures of the Jews</i>, illuminates Judeo-Arabic culture in the Golden Age of Islam; Sephardic culture as it bloomed first on the Iberian Peninsula and later in Amsterdam; and the Jewish-Christian symbiosis in Ashkenazic Europe. It also discusses Jewish culture in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth; the culture of the Italian Jews of the Renaissance period; and representations of folklore and material culture through childbirth rituals throughout the Jewish diaspora.</p><p><b>David Biale</b> is the Emanuel Ringelblum Professor of Jewish History at the University of California, Davis.<b>MERCHANTS AND INTELLECTUALS, RABBIS AND POETS:<br><br>Judeo-Arabic Culture in the Golden Age of Islam<br></b><br><b>Raymond P. Scheindlin</b><br><br> Judah al-Harizi&#x2014;poet, storyteller, and wit&#x2014;writing early in the thirteenth century somewhere in the Arabic-speaking Middle East, relates the following anecdote:<br><br> Yesterday I spent the day with some friends. We saw a crowd gathered at the city gate and were told by a bystander that they had gathered to watch an astrologer tell fortunes. We pushed through the crowd and found at the center a garrulous old man taking astronomical measurements with an astrolabe and offering his services, advertising himself in elaborate and eloquent speeches. People were coming forward one by one to consult him about their troubles in their work and their private lives, and to learn their own fortunes and those of their children. Each received his answer and paid the astrologer&#x2019;s fee.<br><br> I suggested to my friends that we test his powers by agreeing on a question among ourselves: When will the Jews be redeemed from their exile, and when will the Jewish kingdom be restored? When our turn came, we offered him a good fee if he could tell both the question and the answer. The astrologer performed certain rites with sand and lifted his astrolabe. He seemed ready to reply, but instead of launching into his customary eloquence, he sank into a profound and ominous silence. At last, he turned a furious face on us and exclaimed: &#x201c;I swear by the Creator of the radiant light, the sun and the moon, and every constellation that rises and sets, that you are neither Muslims nor Christians, but members of a despised and lowly people! Could you be Jews?&#x201d; &#x201c;Rightly spoken,&#x201d; we replied. He launched into a harangue accusing us of asking about the end of time and history, of wishing for the downfall of the Islamic kingdom, and of rebelling against the state.<br><br> The crowd became so enraged that they would have stoned us to death, but someone persuaded them to take us to a judge. The qadi was a sensible man who saw that we weren&#x2019;t revolutionaries but just young people out on the town enjoying ourselves. He kept us in prison overnight until the crowd dispersed, and in the morning sent us on our way. A narrow escape, thank God!<br><br> This story may serve as an emblem of the style and tone of Jewish life in the Islamic world during the age of Islamic ascendancy. At the beginning of the story, the Jewish boys mix with the crowd in the street. They are unrecognizable as Jews by their speech, bearing, or clothing; they wear no special hat or badge. Even the astrologer, who is supposed to have knowledge of hidden things, says, &#x201c;Could you be Jews?&#x201d; indicating that he is not sure. The boys are conscious of being different from the crowd, but the difference they are conscious of is not primarily that they are Jews so much as the social difference. Within the crowd, assembled adventitiously and united only in its fascination with the astrologer, the youths are a preexisting, closed circle of friends. The people in the crowd believe in the astrologer unquestioningly and come forward with serious questions about their lives, but the youths are skeptical intellectuals whose impulse is to test him. Their skepticism has nothing to do with their being Jewish, for belief<br><br> in astrology crossed religious lines in this period; their test is aimed not at astrology itself but at the astrologer&#x2019;s skill. At the story&#x2019;s beginning, it is not their religion that distinguishes the jaunty youths from the crowd but their class.<br><br> The youths openly mark themselves as a group apart from the crowd by going in together on a question. They never actually enunciate the question, for their purpose is to make it as hard as possible for the astrologer to succeed and, if possible, to discredit him. It is only logical that the astrologer should have to guess the question as well as the answer, for if the question were simply &#x201c;When will Israel be redeemed?&#x201d; there would be no way to verify the answer; thus, the astrologer has to verify his skill by guessing the question that has been agreed upon. We may assume that the showdown nature of the question would heighten the crowd&#x2019;s attention and would therefore have the effect of isolating the group of youths even more.<br><br> The astrologer&#x2019;s speech falls into two parts: the first climaxes with his guess that the youths are Jews; the second is the denunciation. The transition between the two speeches is rich in implications about both parties. The boys&#x2019; callowness is displayed in their blunt reply (contrasting, as it does, with the astrologer&#x2019;s eloquence): &#x201c;Rightly spoken!&#x201d; They acknowledge that they are Jews with no shyness or hesitation, having no inkling of the trouble into which this admission is about to bring them. Are they too surprised by the astrologer&#x2019;s question to lie, or too simple? Whatever the reason, it never occurs to the boys to take advantage of the astrologer&#x2019;s uncertainty, so natural does it seem to them to acknowledge being Jewish.<br><br> The moment the astrologer expresses his doubt, he abandons his professional pretension to knowledge of mysteries and is transformed into an ordinary person. And with the vanishing of this illusion, the fun also vanishes, both for the youths in the story and for us readers. Our astrologer may or may not be a con artist at the beginning of the story&#x2014;the conventions of the genre to which the story belongs would have the medieval reader assume that he is a charlatan&#x2014;but, at the end, we see him as a Muslim who has been shaken by the Jewish youths&#x2019; question (no matter how he divines it). It is a fervent believer who, in his second speech, pours his pious rage (in eloquent Hebrew) on the finally frightened boys. The question of the astrologer&#x2019;s sincerity as a fortune teller vanishes into insignificance in comparison with his sincerity as a Muslim. His encounter with the latent messianic hopes of the Jewish youths takes him out of his role<br><br> as astrologer and turns him into a religious preacher who uses his eloquence to forge the crowd into a group unified in faith and loyalty to their own kind. In the course of this transformation, he ceases to stand above and apart from the crowd&#x2014;in accordance with the normal role of the protagonist in the genre to which the story belongs&#x2014;but merges with the crowd and vanishes from the narrative.<br><br> The story&#x2019;s depiction of the Jewish characters as externally indistinguishable from the Muslim masses, circulating confidently among them without being aware of any need for caution, corresponds with the reality of Jewish life in the Muslim world for most of the period of this chapter, at least during the era of Islamic supremacy, from the seventh to the thirteenth centuries. The Jews were similar to Muslims in most aspects of style, interests, ideas, and taste, and their leaders were affected by the same intellectual trends in theology, philosophy, and literature; furthermore, Jews of all classes benefited from the prosperity of the Islamic world.<br><br> Yet the Jews of Islam were conscious of being members of a group with a different history and a different destiny from those of society at large, as reflected in the question that came most naturally to the minds of the boys: the fate of the Jewish people. Although they moved about comfortably and confidently in their Muslim environment, they were conscious of being in an unsettled state. And, although their people&#x2019;s exile had lasted more than a thousand years, they were still awaiting the Redemption. It turns out that the Jews were not as safe as they thought, for that sustaining hope for redemption was understood by the Muslim majority as implicitly subversive of both the political status quo and the supremacy of Islam. Yet the danger came more from the popular piety of the masses than from the authorities; the official institutions of the state, as represented by the qadi in our story, actually protected the Jews. The qadi applies classic Islamic law to the boys&#x2019; case in denying the crowd the right to harm them. In fact, he is generous. Islam extended to the Jews and Christians within its territories protection in the practice of their religion, in exchange for payment of a specific tax and for maintaining a low profile. By raising the question of the messianic redemption, the boys actually come close to breaking this last understanding; they come close enough to the line to enrage the astrologer and the crowd, but since they do not actually cross it (by, for example, openly blaspheming Islam or its prophet), they do not forfeit their protected status (dhimma).<br><br> The story is typical of the Jewish experience, even its social perspective, for it is written from the point of view of the wealthy, educated elite of the Jewish community. This is typical of the literary sources of the age, which are rich in their testimony of this class&#x2019;s thoughts, beliefs, and imaginations, but whose testimony about the Jewish masses is meager. At the same time, our story affords an exceptionally vivid picture of street life, for literary sources ordinarily tell us little about everyday reality. (As we shall see, we have other sources for such information.)<br><br> Finally, our story illustrates the extent to which literary fashions linked Jewish and Islamic culture. Al-Harizi did not aim to provide readers of a later age with a picture of Jewish life in the streets of Islamic cities; he wrote literature of entertainment, and he related this story as a maqama, a kind of story invented by Arabic writers in the tenth century that was widely imitated by Hebrew writers beginning in the twelfth. Not only is al-Harizi&#x2019;s maqama of the astrologer a perfect example of the Arabic genre in Hebrew, but its line of action and its central motif&#x2014;a group of well-to-do young men who are out for fun, who in the process cross the boundary of religious propriety, and who thereby nearly come to grief at the hands of a mob&#x2014;have a close parallel in an Arabic maqama whose protagonists are all Muslims.<br><br> History<br><br> The Jews of Islam may have been highly acculturated to the manners and values of the Islamic world, but they were not an eccentric or marginal community; they were actually in the mainstream of Jewish history. When, in the seventh and eighth centuries, Arab conquerors seized control of the Persian Empire and the Asian and North African territories of the Byzantine Empire and conquered the rest of North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, they acquired sovereignty over a significant part of the civilized world. Most of the territories conquered at that time&#x2014;Spain and Sicily were the main losses&#x2014;have remained Islamic to this very day. Although in modern times the Islamic world has lost to Europe its earlier advantage in economic, technological, and scientific development, in much of the period from the eighth to the seventeenth centuries it was dominant in all these spheres. Indeed, from the seventh through the thirteenth centuries, Islamdom was the center of the Western world and Europe the periphery; correspondingly, the Jews of the Muslim world were the world&#x2019;s leaders in wealth, culture, and intellectual achievement. They were also the bulk&#x2014;generally estimated as 90 percent&#x2014;of the world&#x2019;s Jews.<br><br> The Jews did not blunder into the Muslim world as immigrants or exiles. They were part of the population of Western Asia, North Africa, and Iberia, now called al-Andalus, where medieval Arabo-Islamic culture developed as an amalgamation of Arabic language, Islamic religion, and local culture. Jews were an intrinsic part of this culture. They resembled their neighbors in their names, dress, and language as well as in most other features of their culture, except, of course, in their religion, their sense of their own distinctness, their view of history, and the institutional affiliations that flowed from these differences.<br><br> In view of the above, the Jewish culture depicted in this chapter will be referred to as Judeo-Arabic culture. Although this term is often used to refer to Jewish writing in the Arabic language, it is useful far beyond the domain of language, for the Arabic character of the Jewish culture we are describing is evident not only in the Jews&#x2019; use of the Arabic language but also in every aspect of their culture during the heyday of premodern Islam&#x2014;even in their practice of religion and in the ways in which they used Hebrew. Thus, we shall use &#x201c;Judeo-Arabic&#x201d; to refer to the culture, and the ordinary language of Judeo-Arabic Jews we shall simply call &#x201c;Arabic.&#x201d;<br><br> To understand the Jews of the Muslim world during the age of Islamic preeminence, the ordinary modern reader is obliged to reorient himself away from Europe and toward the Mediterranean. There he will find a Jewish community quite different from that of either the modern Middle East or medieval Europe: a community that was on the whole prosperous, little subject to persecution, economically well integrated with the environment, and self-confident to the point of being able to adjust to both the external and the internal features of its environment without fear of acculturation. In addition, this community was so productive in its intellectual and literary activities that some of its products have become permanent treasures of the Jewish tradition, and many of them still have the power to fascinate and inspire us with their craft and beauty.<br><br> The Islamic conquests created two new conditions that would enable the Jews to flourish and to create the most successful Jewish Diaspora community of premodern times. First, it united them, for the first time since the expansion of the Diaspora in Hellenistic times, hundreds of years before, into one political, economic, and cultural system, a single Islamic empire stretching from the Indus River in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, including Iberia. Second, it brought relief from persecution, harassment, and humiliation to those Jews who had been living under harsh Christian regimes, especially in Palestine, Egypt, and Spain.<br><br> The Arabs did not embark on their conquests with the intention of converting the world to Islam. On the whole, people converted because conditions under Islamic rule were favorable to Muslims; likewise, they adopted Arabic simply because it was the language of government and public life. Implacably hostile to paganism, Islam respected both Christianity and Judaism for possessing a divinely revealed book, and it viewed them as its sisters in monotheism. Therefore, the Muslims permitted Jews and Christians to retain their ancestral religions, provided they adhered to certain conditions.<br><br> The Jews and Christians were regarded as dhimmis&#x2014;protected subjects&#x2014;and their status was defined by a set of rules known as the Pact of Umar. Dhimmis were guaranteed their lives and property and were tolerated in the practice of their religion in exchange for payment of special taxes and on condition that they behaved in a manner appropriate to a subject population.</p><h2>Mount Vernon Love Story</h2><p>Mary Higgins Clark shows the reader the man behind the legend, a man of flesh, blood and passion in a story that comes dramatically alive</p><p></p><h2>Sirena Selena: A Novel</h2><p><p>Discovered by Martha Divine in the backstreets of San Juan, picking over garbage, drugged out of his mind and singing boleros that transfix the listener, a fifteen year old hustler is transformed into Sirena Selena, a diva whose uncanny beauty and irrisistable voice will be their ticket to fame and fortune.

Based on archives and interviews with Jackie's authors, colleagues, and friends, <i>Reading Jackie</i> mines this significant period of her life to reveal both the serious and the mischievous woman underneath the glamorous public image.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Though Jackie had a reputation for avoiding publicity, she willingly courted controversy in her books. She was the first editor to commission a commercially-successful book telling the story of Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s relationship with his female slave.&nbsp; Her publication of Gelsey Kirkland's attack on dance icon George Balanchine caused another storm. Jackie rarely spoke of her personal life, but many of her books ran parallel to, echoed, and emerged from her own experience. She was the editor behind bestsellers on the assassinations of Tsar Nicholas II and John Lennon, and in another book she paid tribute to the allure of Marilyn Monroe and Maria Callas. Her other projects take us into territory she knew well: journeys to Egypt and India, explorations of the mysteries of female beauty and media exploitation, into the minds of photographers, art historians, and the designers at Tiffany &amp; Co.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Many Americans regarded Jackie as the paragon of grace, but few knew her as the woman sitting on her office floor laying out illustrations, or flying to California to persuade Michael Jackson to write his autobiography. <i>Reading Jackie</i> provides a compelling behind-the-scenes look at Jackie at work: how she commissioned books and nurtured authors, as well as how she helped to shape stories that spoke to her strongly. Jackie is remembered today for her marriages to JFK and to Aristotle Onassis, but her real legacy is the books that reveal the tastes, recollections, and passions of an independent woman.</p></p><p>WILLIAM KUHN is a biographer and historian.

I'M READING.<br><br>-Jackie to her roommate, Nancy Tuckerman,<br><br>at Miss Porter's School<br><br>�<br><br>Miss Porter's School is a college prep school for girls arranged in a dozen historic houses on either side of a two-lane highway running through Farmington, a suburb of Hartford, Connecticut. Most of the girls are boarders, but a few are day students from the neighborhood. The most remarkable thing about the adolescent girls who go there is how utterly at ease they are with adults. They look you in the eye, smile, say hello, and are unafraid of strangers, as if to say, "If you are here, you must belong here, just like I do." Nancy Tuckerman's explanation of what made the school tick in the 1940s was that it was "very much a family school. My mother went there, her sister went there, my sister went there. Jackie's sister, Lee, went there, and their half-sister, Janet Auchincloss, went there too." All that was long ago, before the school started reaching out to nontraditional constituencies in hopes of increasing diversity and reducing its reputation for exclusivity, but even now the place has the feeling of educating polished, confident girls who will one day have a chance both to earn and to inherit everything good that life has to offer. Everybody thinks that Jacqueline Bouvier was the sort of girl who was made for Miss Porter's, but in fact an important part of her never entirely fit in there.<br><br>She was shy, something of a loner, and looked for ways to spend time by herself. At the end of the day, when the girls would gather in one another's dorm rooms before lights-out to talk and gossip about the day, Jackie preferred to stay alone in her room reading a book. "Often French literature," Nancy Tuckerman reminisced, distinctly pronouncing it "lit-ra-toor" and conveying the idea of the very proper school Miss Porter's was when she and Jackie were there together. One girl's mother wouldn't have her daughter rooming with Jackie because she thought one of the points of Miss Porter's was to socialize and meet people. Rooming with Jackie would mean rooming with someone who didn't much like to mix with the other girls. It wasn't that Jackie was unpopular or disliked by the other girls, but she was private, reserved, and aloof long before the paparazzi ever pointed a camera in her direction. She had friends, but books and literature were her real intimates.<br><br>Girls near graduation who had good academic records were allowed to spend study hall in their rooms. Jackie had this privilege. The room she shared with Tuckerman was at the top of a big Classical Revival house built in 1800, their two single beds wedged in under sloping eaves and their window looking out on old shade trees. Sometimes they would both be up there together, reading their books in bed. Tuckerman loved to laugh and was drawn to Jackie's sense of humor. The friendship Jackie extended to her was so rare a privilege, it would have been hard not to prize it, even when sometimes, late in the day, Tuckerman would think it was all right to raise some conversation, only to be interrupted by Jackie, who would say, "Ssh! I'm reading" and give her a look that made them both lie back laughing against the pillows.<br><br>Despite Jackie's love of books, she spent a lifetime trying to prevent people from writing them about her. Yet she did authorize one biography, written and published by Mary Van Rensselaer Thayer. Thayer was a member of one of New England's founding families. Her ancestors had settled in the Hudson River valley as far back as the days when New York was New Amsterdam. She was a friend of Jackie's mother, and her book, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, was published in 1961 as part of the publicity blitz that accompanied the beginning of John F. Kennedy's presidency. The book is far from a tame whitewash of Jackie's early life, however. When Jackie found that in an early draft of the book Thayer was quoting from letters that her mother had lent to Thayer, she asked her mother and her friends to stop cooperating. Jackie did not stop the book, but she made her displeasure with some of what the book revealed known.<br><br>Thayer noted that when Jackie was still young, she started putting together a little library of her own of books about ballet: "She knew she could never be a ballet dancer but she did think, for a bit, that she might be part of the show, by designing ballet and theatrical costumes." That sense early on of what she could not do was at the nub of Jackie's self-image as a reader. Coupled with the sense of limitation was a determination to work around it, to participate in the creative and artistic activity that gripped her imagination. The little girl who decided before she was in her teens that she could not be a dancer would grow into a woman who published books on half a dozen of the most important dancers of the twentieth century.<br><br>Thayer's biography tells of the books Jackie read when she was young. She read <i>Gone With the Wind</i> three times. There were ways in which some of the operatic characters from the book resembled people in Jackie's own family. Jackie's mother, Janet, divorced Jackie's father, Jack Bouvier, in 1940, when Jackie was eleven years old. The man who had got his nickname, "Black Jack," from his permanent suntan spent the rest of his life in a succession of New York apartments, sometimes looked after by girlfriends, sometimes not, spending beyond his means and trading on the stock exchange. Janet remarried in 1942. Her new husband, Hugh Auchincloss, was a rich man, the heir to Standard Oil money, which he used to found a stock brokerage in Washington, D.C. He maintained a big house called Merrywood in Virginia and another, Hammersmith Farm, in Newport for the summer. He had a son from a previous marriage, just two years older than Jackie, who was known in the family as Yusha. Yusha Auchincloss remembered that Jackie also loved the movies, and <i>Gone With the Wind</i> was one of her favorites. "Rhett Butler reminded her of her father, Scarlett O'Hara of her mother," he said. The grand southern house of the movie, Tara, reminded her of Merrywood and Hammersmith rolled together. Jackie's stepbrother also thought that Jackie "had a lot of Scarlett's qualities, the same ones as her mother had, good and not so good." Jackie grew up patterning herself on one of the most famous temperamental divas of the 1930s and '40s, both the character in the book and Vivien Leigh's depiction of her on the screen. Scarlett O'Hara could be shrewd and selfish as well as self-sacrificing, and it's difficult to tell which of those features drew Jackie to read about her again and again. Jackie might also have seen that her own family dramas sometimes paled before the melodrama on the page, and in that sense the saga of Scarlett and Rhett was a comfort.<br><br>Jackie learned to look for men in books, too. Yusha Auchincloss recalled that "as a teenager she devoured Tolstoy's <i>War and Peace</i> and Sir Walter Scott's <i>Ivanhoe</i>. Courage and chivalry were tops on her list of qualities she admired most in men." Another model for how men should behave was in the children's story Little Lord Fauntleroy, by Frances Hodgson Burnett, about an American boy living in Brooklyn who discovers that he is heir to an earldom when his English grandfather, the earl, sends a lawyer to visit his mother. The American boy, undaunted by the prospect of a big house and a title, inadvertently teaches his grandfather about kindness and compassion toward the less well-off. Jackie wrote in her essay for Vogue that little Lord Fauntleroy's grandfather was one of her heroes. It is interesting that she identified with the corrupt old aristocrat rather than the hero of the story. Perhaps she dreamed of high caste and riches, as many little girls do, but appreciated adult wickedness, too. All three of these books imagine a life lived in castles and palaces, among reckless and courageous European nobles. The humble March sisters of Louisa May Alcott's <i>Little Women</i> were not for Jackie.<br><br>Nor is it surprising to find her a little in love with Lord Byron, the bad boy of English Romantic poets, a dandy who had affairs with young men and his own half-sister as well as a string of eligible women. Thayer notes that as Jackie "edged into her teens, Lord Byron became a beloved companion. She read and reread his poems and lived his life through the pages" of Byron's biography. Her father, who was a dandy too, who was rumored to have been bisexual (he had been a friend of Cole Porter's at Yale), and who had the insouciance to be photographed holding the hand of one of his girlfriends as he stood behind his wife's back, was about as Byronic a man as one could find on Long Island in the 1930s. Rhett Butler, Byron, and Black Jack Bouvier merged together in Jackie's reading life to sustain her image of where she came from as well as to give her an idea of where she might like to go.<br><br>One of the letters from Jackie's father that Mary Thayer put into her book tells of how much he was going to hate losing her when she found a boyfriend or a husband. Black Jack wrote that he supposed "it won't be long until I lose you to some funny-looking 'gink' "&#x2014;slang for an odd boy&#x2014;"who you think is wonderful because he is romantic-looking in the evening and wears his mother's pearl earrings for dress-shirt buttons, because he loves her so." In other words, he was afraid she'd marry a mama's boy who wore ladies' pearls in his shirtfront. As a snazzy dresser himself, perhaps Bouvier was projecting some vision of himself that she might like to marry, but there's no question that she remained attached to him long beyond the grave. As an adult, she kept no pictures of JFK or Onassis in her library, her favorite room in her New York apartment. The biggest framed photo sitting on a side table was of Black Jack.<br><br>Romances by the Book<br><br>A few years later, one of the ways in which Jackie first connected with JFK was via books. When she went to Europe on an assignment in 1953 for the <i>Washington Times-Herald</i>, her companion remembers, Jackie loaded her suitcase on the return trip with books to take back to the young senator she was dating. One of JFK's favorite books, Lord David Cecil's biography of the nineteenth-century British prime minister Lord Melbourne, captured the very era in which Byron flourished. Melbourne's first wife, Lady Caroline Lamb, had been one of Byron's lovers. The biography describes untamed aristocrats who were committed to public service at the same time that they did not give a damn what the public thought about their louche private lives. In that era, before many people could vote, they did not have to care. JFK had first learned to admire the idea of a wealthy aristocrat's obligation to serve the state-noblesse oblige-when he had lived in London with his father, who was the American ambassador to Britain in the late 1930s. This idea of state service combined with playing a role in history and doing whatever you pleased in private life was one of JFK's key points of contact with Jackie.<br><br>As a reader of history and lover of books, Jackie was highly conscious of the way in which European monarchs had encouraged the creation of works of art by becoming patrons of artists. In the White House she saw her job as nothing less than raising the profile of the creative arts in America. Book collecting was one of the most important attributes of European kingship. The core of the British Library, one of the best collections in the world, was the product of King George III's passion for book collecting. The gift of his library to the British nation was one of his legacies, more memorable than his blindness about the American colonies. Jackie refused to accept the traditional cultural divide between Britain and America, between European and American attitudes toward the arts. She took European court culture as her pattern. One of Jackie's lesser-known projects in the White House years was beginning the work to found a White House library, later completed under President Johnson. She asked the academic editors of the Adams Papers and the Jefferson Papers to advise on the creation of such a library, one that would be appropriate to a house built in the early decades of the nineteenth century and to the shared philosophy of the nation's founders. What books should it have? She wanted the library to be available for use, not just for show. In 1962, Arthur Schlesinger, on leave from Harvard while he served on JFK's staff, was helping her to select a book to take as a gift to Jawaharlal Nehru when she went on a state visit to India. They agreed on a first edition of Thoreau's <i>Civil Disobedience</i> as being intellectually related to the philosophy of India's founding statesman, Mahatma Gandhi. She wrote a letter to Schlesinger agreeing that "a library is dead if not used." She also observed that White House staffers were entirely capable of "pinching" the books and teased Schlesinger by asking him to sit in the library dressed in historic costume to discourage theft.<br><br>Late in her life, in a note to Carl Sferrazza Anthony, who was writing a book on American first ladies, Jackie went out of her way to say how she cared about American history. Anthony had started doing his research early. When he was a boy in the 1960s he began writing to Nancy Tuckerman in the White House, asking her for memorabilia. Perhaps because of this persistence and the fact that both women could remember that he had written to them years before, Jackie was unusually frank with him. It still bothered her that many Americans considered her unpatriotic-in the 1960s some had accused her of being too French or European. Jackie told Anthony that she remembered her step-uncle, Wilmarth "Lefty" Lewis, the editor of the Horace Walpole Papers at Yale, telling her as a girl that of the three greatest men alive in the eighteenth century&#x2014;Denis Diderot, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson&#x2014;two were American. She did not want to make the White House European. She wanted to raise the public profile of a long intellectual tradition that stood behind the American presidency, one that was the equal of any European court.</p><h2>Flying Too High: Miss Phryne Fisher Investigates (A Phryne Fisher Mystery)</h2><p>Another runaway adventure with glamorous heroine Phryne Fisher!Whether foiling kidnappers&#39; plans, walking the wings of a Tiger Moth or simply deciding what to wear for dinner, Phryne handles everything with her usual panache and flair!Here, the 1920&#39;s most glamorous detective flies even higher, handling an abduction and a murder with style and ease... all before it&#39;s time to adjourn to the Queenscliff Hotel for breakfast.

Emily Anderson had waited all her life for this moment. The box on the floor in front of her held the hope of a lifetime . . . her lifetime. Inside could be a window, a glimpse, a pathway to the past, to a time still littered with question marks. But what if it wasn&#39;t? What if it was nothing? For a moment Emily could only sit, stone still, and stare at it. Doubts gathered around her like summer storm clouds. This was her last chance. If the box held only high school mementoes, framed photographs, and old stuffed animals, then she&#39;d know she&#39;d reached her final dead end. And barring a miracle, her search for her parents would be over. She laid her hands on the dusty cardboard top and traced her fingers across the words. Lauren&#39;s Things. The box would be nearly nineteen years old now. A lump stuck in her throat and she swallowed, forcing it down. &#39;Mom . . .&#39; she stared at her mother&#39;s name. &#39;Did you leave me a trail?&#39; She closed her eyes and hugged the box. &#39;Please, God, let there be something here.&#39; Downstairs her grandparents were fixing dinner. They&#39;d given her this time. Her tender old papa had found the worn box in the garage stashed away in a cobwebbed corner with a dozen other forgotten cartons. He had known how much it would mean to her, how long she&#39;d been waiting for a breakthrough like this. &#39;Emily, honey,&#39; he&#39;d told her when she came home from college that day. &#39;This belonged to your mother.&#39; He held the box in his hands. As tall as she was, she still felt tiny next to him. He had to look around the brown edges of the box to see her. &#39;I&#39;ll take it to your room. You&#39;ll need some time.&#39; Indeed. She opened her eyes and stared at the box, hard and long, drilling imaginary holes through the flimsy cardboard. As if maybe she could see inside before she tore into it and found out for sure. Panic tap-danced around her, and she grabbed two quick breaths. What if she went through the whole thing and found no clues at all? Two more breaths. Come on, Emily. Exhale. She tightened her middle, pursed her lips, and blew out. God, get me through this. There has to be something. How many times had she prayed for a clue or a sign? A trail that would lead her to her parents, even for a day? Then she could ask them why they&#39;d left and how come they never cared to find out what happened to their little girl? Emotion flooded her, tightening her throat, closing her eyes. Memories rushed back like forgotten classmates --- hateful ones, who used to laugh when you weren&#39;t picked at recess. Suddenly she was in kindergarten again, at the Mother&#39;s Day luncheon. She and the other boys and girls had made place mats with bright green handprints and pretty painted flowers coming from the top of every finger. They sang a song, and Emily could hear their young, off-key voices booming out, &#39;Thanks for all you do . . . Mommy, I love you!&#39; As with everything around Mother&#39;s Day, Emily directed the words to her grandma. Even back then, she&#39;d known. She was the only kindergartner without a mother. The only one whose mommy left when she was just a few weeks old. Now she watched her kindergarten self as the memory of what happened next played back, every painful detail intact . . . &#39;Grandma,&#39; she asked, &#39;where is my mommy? Do you know?&#39; Her grandmother got sort of nervous. &#39;No, sweetie. Papa and I tried to find her but, well, we haven&#39;t had any luck.&#39; Emily had felt suddenly lost. Like the day she was at the park and couldn&#39;t find her papa. Then an idea came to her. She smoothed her fancy dress and swung her legs, setting her patentleather shoes in motion. &#39;Maybe I could find her!&#39; &#39;Honey.&#39; Her grandma patted her hair. &#39;I don&#39;t think she wants to be found.&#39; And that was that. Emily drew a shuddering breath, relieved that the memory was over. But on its heels came another. The time she was thirteen and all of eighth grade was getting &#39;the talk.&#39; &#39;I feel funny talking about girl stuff in school,&#39; she told one of her friends at lunch that day. &#39;Seems like it should be private.&#39; &#39;So talk to your mom.&#39; The friend smiled. &#39;Moms are great for that.&#39; The emptiness and loss were so terrible, Emily felt like an actual hole in her heart, a hole so thorough she bet her friend could see straight through her. That afternoon, Emily went home and made a promise. Someday, I&#39;m going to find my parents. No matter what. Emily brushed a hand across her face, as though she could free her mind from the haunting thoughts. She opened her eyes and stared at the box. Eventually her grandparents got Internet access. After that there were days of typing in her mother&#39;s name --- L-a-u-r-e-n A-n-d-e-r-s-o-n --- and searching through lists of schoolteachers and scientists and track stars, but never --- not in all the thousand entries that popped up, making her breathless with possibility --- did she find her mother. Same with her dad. She&#39;d spent hopeless afternoons looking for him any way she could imagine. And now, at eighteen, she was no closer to finding them than when she first started. What she wanted --- what she&#39;d always wanted --- was the truth. Because the sketchy details she knew made up barely a handful of dots. Nowhere near enough to connect. Cobwebs stuck to the top of the box, and Emily brushed them off. She let her hands rest on the old, worn carton, wondering. Could it be? Did this box hold the secrets --- secrets that would answer the questions that had haunted Emily all her life? Why did her mother leave? Where was she? Why hadn&#39;t she been in touch since she ran away? Had her parents ever connected again? She gripped the top of the box. Maybe . . . maybe she was about to discover enough pieces to put together a trail. And maybe the trail would lead her to the story. She couldn&#39;t wait another minute as she opened the side flaps. It was really happening; she was about to see her mother&#39;s things, touch them and read them and breathe them in. Her heart beat so hard and fast she wondered if her grandparents could hear it downstairs. She peered inside. The first few items were framed photographs of her parents. Emily reached in, lifting them with careful fingers. Beneath them were yearbooks and folded handwritten letters. Emily&#39;s heart jumped. Hours of exploration stretched before her. As she pulled out the contents of the box, she lay each item on her bed, staring at it even as she reached for the next item.</p><h2>Crashed</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>A Wrinkle in Time</h2><p>Meg Murry and her friends become involved with unearthly strangers and a search for Meg&#39;s father, who has disappeared while engaged in secret work for the government</p><p>Everyone in town thinks Meg is volatile and dull-witted and that her younger brother Charles Wallace is dumb.

She confesses that when told that her leading man in the 1933 Kong epic was Hollywood's "tallest, darkest," she happily anticipated Cary Grant, not the great ape who "had a pretty strong hold on me." Wray, born in Canada in 1908, was 17 when she first appeared in silent films; she made the transition to talkies and, ultimately, performed in some 75 movies between 1925 and 1958. Among her reminiscences of co-workers like Lillian Gish and Gary Cooper, her recollection of working with Erich von Stroheim in The Wedding March is the most vivid. Wray's personal life evokes sympathy. Her marriage to unstable screen writer John Monk Saunders ended badly. There are accounts of the actress's unfulfilling relationships with other menplaywright Clifford Odets, for onebefore her 1942 marriage to late screenwriter Robert Riskin. Photos not seen by PW . <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Although she has made over 75 movies, Wray will always be identified with the classic film King Kong . Here she tells the rest of the story. Her autobiography is well written in a bright, anecdotal style fueled by her vivid recollections. Sent to California at age 13, she eventually secured a movie contract that initiated a lifetime of theater and film work. Wray recounts the good and bad times and her encounters with many famous personalities. She also sheds light on the early days of filmmaking, including, of course, her role in King Kong . Enjoyable reading and the most detailed account of Wray's life and career available, this is worthwhile for any film collection.

Through his work with the bands Black Flag and the Rollins Group, he has earned a reputation as one of music&#x2019;s most relentless live artists, often touring around the globe several times a year without a single break. His books include "Solipsist" and "Get in the Van: On the Road with Black Flag." </p><p>Afterword by LEMMY KILMISTER </p><p>Widely recognized as the "Godfather of Heavy Metal," Lemmy Kilmister and his band Motorhead have been punishing eardrums with their patented brand of ultra-hard rock since 1975. A prolific songwriter whose pen has fueled twenty albums and hit songs recorded by Ozzy Osbourne, Metallica, and Guns n&#x2019; Roses, Lemmy is also a World War II historian of some renown. His life is the subject of an acclaimed new documentary called "Lemmy," which is drawing rave reviews on the international film circuit.</p>With varying degrees of success, Quisling and Williams reconstruct 40 years of hip-shaking, headbanging, altered consciousness and groupie-love at Sunset Strip nightclubs Whisky A Go-Go and its sister establishments the Roxy Theatre and the Rainbow Bar and Grill, in an attempt to bring to life the L.A. music scene since 1964. Focusing on 16 random events meant to emblemize the Whiskey ambiance and demonstrate its cultural impact, the authors chronicle the club from its early Tinsletown days to the Black Flag riots during the punk movement to a more current era of "unknown die-hard Sunset Strip devotees." The list of acts that have graced the stage of Whisky is a veritable who's who of rock, and while the authors do well to avoid a simple listing of these acts, the stories they focus on aren't always compelling. Tales of Jim Morrison passed out back stage or Roger Daltrey's sexual exploits fail to bring the Whisky to life. Quisling and Williams also choose an awkward, unintegrated format for the book, with the first part of each chapter (by Williams) a vivid, occasionally overwritten anecdote (does he really know what Robert Plant thought as he felt up two sisters under a table?), followed by a separate cultural and historical outline of the era (by Quisling). Williams recounts the time Charles Manson dropped by the Whisky just days before the mass killings at Benedict Canyon, harassed a waitress and was thrown out by the owner, Mario Maglieri. It's a compelling story, but following it with a separate, brief history of Helter Skelter, the authors clumsily connect the Whisky to the world outside the club doors. Central to rock 'n' roll history, the Whisky was a place of raw, untethered emotion, debauchery and mayhem. Quisling and Williams are certainly passionate about their subject, and their energy goes a long way toward making the book readable, but they don't fully capture its heart and soul. As Henry Rollins claims in his surprisingly bland foreword, the Whisky "is worth some real documentation." Unfortunately, this isn't quite it. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Audubon Backyard Birdwatcher: Birdfeeders and Bird Gardens</h2><p>Presents information on how to use birdfeeders and landscaping in the garden to attract birds, with discussions of bird behavior and profiles of the most common garden birds, describing plumage, voice, feeding, and nesting habits.</p><p><b>Robert Burton</b> studied as a zoologist and is a well-established author in the field of &#x201c;domestic&#x201d; natural history.

A former bookseller, Petterson lives in Oslo, Norway.</p>Starred Review. This 1996 novel predates Pettersen's acclaimed <i>Out Stealing Horses</i> (first published in 2003), and has all of Pettersen's haunted charms. As an unnamed young girl and her big brother, Jesper (who calls her Sistermine), grow up in rural WWII-era Denmark, the two cope with distant parents, an eccentric extended family and the cold wind. Jesper longs to go south to Morocco; Sistermine yearns for the plains of Siberia, foreshadowing lives that will diverge. Their grandfather's suicide, the arrival of puberty and most tragically, the German invasion change their idyllic childhood relationship; as each sibling fights back against the occupation in his or her own way, their inevitable separation looms. The second half of the novel, in which Sistermine struggles to make sense of her life in various Scandinavian cities and towns, awaiting a hoped-for reunion with Jesper, is less breathtaking and mesmerizing than the first, but the contrast makes her numb loneliness and inability to connect all the more poignant. The book builds up slowly, casting a spell of beauty and devastation that matches the bleak but dazzling climate that enshrouds Sistermine's young life. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And not since that fateful year, when Mansell, Piquet and Prost went head-to-head, has a season so captured the world's attention and drawn so many new spectators to the sport - for reasons both on and off the track. <br> It wasn't meant to be that way. When Fernando Alonso joined McLaren for 2007, the unspoken assumption was that the double world champion would steadily proceed to his third title in a row. He would have done exactly that, but for a development no-one could have foreseen. Carl Lewis Hamilton, a relative unknown and just twenty-two-years old, would climb into the other McLaren-Mercedes and captivate the world with consistently brilliant performances. Even as it welcomed this new prodigy, however, the world of Formula One was rocked by accusations of spying between McLaren and their bitter rivals Ferrari; accusations that resulted in millions of pounds in fines and an ill feeling between the teams, their drivers and the governing body that now threatens the future of the sport.<br> Revisiting the 1986 season to contrast it with the world of F1 today, and applying his extensive experience as an award-winning motor-sport journalist for over 30 years, Maurice Hamilton provides a review of a season that will be remembered as one of the most important and unique in the sport's history. Analysing the individual races in expert detail as well as looking at the drivers themselves, CHEQUERED CONFLICT in its look at how radically the sport has changed in those twenty years, will become a classic of its genre.</p><p>Maurice Hamilton is an award-winning motor sport journalist who has contributed to the <i>Guardian</i>, the <i>Independent,</i> and the <i>Observer,</i> and the author of several books on racing.</p><h2>Craig Claiborne&#39;s A Feast Made for Laughter</h2><p>The entertaining memoirs of the world-renowned culinary expert chronicles his early life, colorful career, and epicurean adventures, and includes one hundred of the author&#39;s favorite recipes and a list of recommended cookbooks</p><p></p><h2>They Call Me Naughty Lola: Personal Ads from the London Review of Books</h2><p>A whimsical collection of personal ads as published in the London Review of Books is comprised of some of the lonely-hearts column&#39;s most biting and erudite entries, in which hopefuls abandoned both positivism and false advertising in their quests for desirable partners. 50,000 first printing.</p><p><b>David Rose</b> works at the New York office of the <i>LRB</i> and divides his time between New York, Liverpool and California."A compendium of the weirdest and funniest advertisements from eccentric readers." -- <i>Seattle Times</i><br><br>"This compilation of hilarious personal ads placed in the London Review of Books celebrates the odd, the quirky, and the painfully honest in their search for love." -- <i>Boston Herald</i></p><h2>To Know Her by Name (Rocky Mountain Memories #3)</h2><p>Wounded after killing an outlaw in the Boulder foothills, McKay Harrington finds himself attracted to the mysterious woman who nurses him back to health, but will not speak</p><p>Lori Wick is a multifaceted author of Christian fiction.

Since that time, the American flag has been raised high in wartime triumph and peacetime celebration; burned in fervent protest; sewn lovingly onto quilts, caps, pillows, and bags; appropriated by the commercial sphere to sell goods as varied as cigars, and designer clothing, and rock-and-roll albums; and faithfully honored every 4th of July to celebrate America's independence. This collection of more than 3,000 Stars and Stripes artifacts ranges from Civil War-era banners and Native American braided moccasins to an early 20th-century "friendship" kimono and original flag art by several of the world's leading designers. In its deluxe format with over 500 illustrations, LONG MAY SHE WAVE gives wide berth to the flag in all its manifestations, and the result is a stunning visual history of America'�?s most treasured symbol.Full-color throughout, with over 500 illustrations in a deluxe 11 x 14-inch volume-LONG MAY SHE WAVE is the perfect gift for folk-art appreciators, history buffs, and collectors.Features the 3,000-piece exhibit that was displayed at the American Institute of Graphic Arts and the San Jose Museum of Art in 2000.

Renowned Catholic commentator Richard McBrien offers a fresh, intelligent look at each of the 262 popes, including:-The Apostle Peter, the first pope, in his singular role as Vicar of ChristFormosus, the pope whose corpse was exhumed, dressed in full vestments, and subjected to a mock trial for papal misdeedsBoniface, elected pope after having been defrocked twice for immoralityJohn XXIII, perhaps the most beloved pope in all of historyLives of the Popes provides chronologically arranged biographies of the pontiffs, revealing the full sweep of the papacy. Each entry contains essential information on a pontiff&#x2019;s life, major writings, controversies, and deeds both great and evil. McBrien eloquently and powerfully brings to life the unique stories of the popes and reveals how they transformed Christianity and the world.John Paul II, the present Bishop of Rome</p><p><p>Richard P. McBrien is Crowley-O'Brien Professor of Theology at the University of Notre Dame. Educated at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, he has also served as president of the Catholic Theological Society of America. A leading authority on Catholicism, he is the bestselling author of <em>Catholicism</em>, <em>Lives of the Popes</em>, and <em>Lives of the Saints</em>, as well as the general editor of <em>The HarperCollins Encyclopedia of Catholicism</em>. Most recently a consultant for ABC News, McBrien offers regular commentary on all the major television networks. He is also a prizewinning syndicated columnist in the Catholic press.</p>Reviewing 262 popes, McBrien (theology, Univ. of Notre Dame) expands the sketches in his Encyclopedia of Catholicism (LJ 6/1/95) and provides broad historical and theological contexts for each profile, relying on the many-editioned Liber Pontificalis and The Oxford Dictionary of Popes (1986), as well as other scholarly works. McBrien addresses the nonspecialist reader and groups his entries into eight historical periods with distinctive theological and pastoral interpretations. His approach is down to earth and critical, distinguishing pious legend from known fact. The well-written sketches vary from a paragraph to several pages, ranging from Peter to John Paul II. Supplementary appendixes and tables enhance the book for reference as well as circulating use. Recommended for academic and public libraries.

Her first novel, <i>Lara</i>, won the EMMA (Ethnic Multicultural Media Awards) Best Book Award in 1999. A former Poet in Residence at the Museum of London, she won an Arts Council of Britain Writers' Award in 2000.Employing the same narrative verse style that served her so well in her debut, Lara, British writer Evaristo travels back in time to tell the story of Zuleika, a libidinous but frustrated Sudanese woman who comes of age in a Roman-conquered London in A.D. 211. Spotted at the age of 11 by rich Roman senator Lucius Aurelius Felix, "a man thrice my age and thrice my girth," she lands in the lap of luxury when a wedding quickly takes place. But Felix's lack of libido soon turns the marriage into a prison, and when he begins to travel, jazzy teenager Zuleika hits the social scene in the urban maze that is Londinium and receives some flattering attention from a visiting Roman emperor, Septimus Severus. The two begin a brief but torrid affair until Evaristo wraps up her thin plot by sending Severus off to war as Felix returns to find that the entire community knows about the affair. Plot problems aside, most of this is an excuse for Evaristo to stretch her poetic muscles as she creates a beautiful, passionate African-cum-Roman woman as seen through the imagination of a highly liberated and sexual 21st-century poet. Despite the occasional burst of purple verse, she succeeds admirably in bringing a difficult and treacherous conceit to fruition, liberally indulging in irreverent asides, vivid vernacular speech and clever puns. The generally high quality of the poetry overshadows the failure of the book to develop into a genuine, full-fledged novel. This is a vividly imagined albeit distinctly modern look at a woman's role in Roman times by a talented writer with a fertile mind and a playful spirit. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Mammoth Book of Tattoos (Mammoth Books)</h2><p>This collection covers all styles of tattoos from bold tribal pieces, Chines characters, and hieroglyphs to delicate air-brushed designs.

Even though these charges come from those who hold postmillenial or premillennial views, they still set forth a need for a statement of these things most surely believed among amillennialists. In our examination of amillennialism we shall deal somewhat with the history of this movement, some of its outstanding leaders, and its cardinal beliefs. In the latter category it will be necessary to settle for a majority view of their beliefs, since not every exponent of amillennialism would agree on every point of Scripture. Nor do they even attempt a forced conformity as a basis of fellowship. Amillennialism oversteps denominational lines; in fact, it oversteps theological lines. Men who agree on what the Bible has to say, or does not have to say, with reference to the millennium may stand poles apart on other cardinal doctrines of the Bible. Some of these differences will be enumerated later. What we are dealing with here is cardinal beliefs of amillennialism, and not cardinal doctrines of the entire Bible</p><p></p><h2>Impresario: The Life and Times of Ed Sullivan</h2><p>� Sullivan has nearly 100% name recognition among people 40 and older<br><br>� In a survey of the fifty most influential programs in the U.S., <i>TV Guide</i> ranked <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i> #10<br><br>� Show still appears on PBS and on cable stations across the country<br><br>� Sixty million baby boomers grew up watching <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i><br>For more than twenty years, from 1948 to 1971, fifty-five million viewers watched <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i> religiously every Sunday night.

But despite Ed Sullivan&#x2019;s prominence, little was known about the private man...until now. <b>Impresario</b> reveals what the Sullivan viewers never saw: nasty, hot-tempered, craven, yet also capable of high ideals and, above all, hugely ambitious. At a time when Americans are looking back, The Ed Sullivan Show stands out as a shining example of television during the golden era. <b>Impresario</b> lets readers look behind the screen to see the man who made it happen.</p><p>Advance Praise for IMPRESARIO <p>"James Maguire's Impresario has many of the qualities of the great American institution it celebrates. It's as lively, entertaining, hugely enjoyable and even as full of variety as The Ed Sullivan Show in its prime-time prime. Rich in detail about the really big 'shew' and the backstage madness behind it, the book evokes an era dominated by a strange, stage-crazed showman who knew what we wanted &#x2013; sometimes before we did &#x2013; and gave it to us every week. </p><p>More than another showbiz saga, Impresario brings back a time when the family, and the nation, were brought together by a medium still galvanizing and magical.

These nineteen stories--selected by Trevor himself from <b>The Collected Stories</b> and <b>After Rain</b>--capture the nuances of rural and middle-class life in the Ireland he knows so well. Here are its people, their lives driven by love, faith, and duty, surviving in a culture that blends tradition with transformation. In spare and eloquent prose Trevor's stories engage and provoke us as only the best fiction can.</p><p>When a William Trevor story comes saddled with the title "The Paradise Lounge" or "The Ballroom of Romance," readers can be fairly certain there's a heavy dose of irony involved. Acclaimed as one of the finest English-language writers living today, Trevor specializes in lives crippled by low expectations. In <i>Ireland</i>, selected from his previous volumes, <i>Collected Stories</i> and <i>After Rain</i>, he assembles a cast of assorted dreamers, loners, and hard-luck cases and then chronicles their disappointments with a compassionate but profoundly unsentimental eye. "The Paradise Lounge" is a rundown hotel bar where Trevor juxtaposes two adulterous loves, from two different generations; one affair has been consummated, the other not, but each is bitterly envious of the other. In "The Piano Tuner's Wives," a blind man's new wife becomes jealous of her predecessor. Instead of describing the world around him as his first wife did, Belle lies to her husband, who resigns himself to the situation: "Belle could not be blamed for making her claim, and claims could not be made without damage or destruction." Other stories find the specter of the Troubles lurking in the background, as in "Beyond the Pale" or "Lost Ground," in which Irish violence assumes the nasty inevitability of fate: "Milton's death was the way things were, the way things had to be: that was their single consolation." Throughout, the writing is simple, luminous, and characteristically lovely. Like Chekhov, another master of understatement, Trevor can paint an entire world with a single stroke of his brush. Trevor's characters are willing to settle for very little, and they seldom even get that. His readers, however, get everything they could possibly ask for.<b>William Trevor&nbsp;</b>was born in Mitchelstown, County Cork, and spent his childhood in provincial Ireland.

As the first air war of the nuclear age, it posed a major challenge to the service to define and successfully carry out its mission by stretching the constraints of limited war while avoiding the excesses of total war.<br><br>Conrad Crane analyzes both the successes and failures of the air force in Korea, offering a balanced treatment of how the air war in Korea actually unfolded. He examines the Air Force's contention that it could play a decisive role in a non-nuclear regional war but shows that the fledgling service was held to unrealistically high expectations based on airpower's performance in World War II, despite being constrained by the limited nature of the Korean conflict.<br><br>Crane exposes the tensions and rivalries between services, showing that emphasis on strategic bombing came at the expense of air support for ground troops, and he tells how interactions between army and air force generals shaped the air force's mission and strategy. He also addresses misunderstandings about plans to use nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons in the war and includes new information from pilot correspondence about the informal policy of "hot pursuit" over the Yalu that existed at the end of the war.<br><br>The book considers not only the actual air effort in Korea but also its ramifications. The air force doubled in size during the war and used that growth to secure its position in the defense establishment, but it wagered its future on its ability to deliver nuclear weapons in a high-intensity conflict&#x2014;a position that left it unprepared to fight the next limited war in Vietnam.<br><br>As America observes the fiftieth anniversary of its initial engagement in Korea, Crane's book is an important reminder of the lessons learned there. And as airpower continues to be a cornerstone of American defense, this examination of its uses in Korea provides new insights about the air force's capabilities and limitations.</p><p>"A first-class piece of work and significant contribution to the Korean War literature.

It ended in victory for the United States, yet it was a costly triumph, claiming trillions of dollars in defense spending and the lives of nearly 100,000 U.S. soldiers. Apocalyptic anti-communism sharply limited the range of acceptable political debate, while American actions overseas led to the death of millions of innocent civilians and destabilized dozens of nations that posed no threat to the United States. </p><p> </p><p> In a brilliant new interpretation, Campbell Craig and Fredrik Logevall reexamine the successes and failures of America&#x2019;s Cold War. The United States dealt effectively with the threats of Soviet predominance in Europe and of nuclear war in the early years of the conflict. But in engineering this policy, American leaders successfully paved the way for domestic actors and institutions with a vested interest in the struggle&#x2019;s continuation. Long after the USSR had been effectively contained, Washington continued to wage a virulent Cold War that entailed a massive arms buildup, wars in Korea and Vietnam, the support of repressive regimes and counterinsurgencies, and a pronounced militarization of American political culture. </p><p> </p><p> American foreign policy after 1945 was never simply a response to communist power or a crusade contrived solely by domestic interests. It was always an amalgamation of both. This provocative book lays bare the emergence of a political tradition in Washington that feeds on external dangers, real or imagined, a mindset that inflames U.S. foreign policy to this day. </p></p><p>Campbell Craig is Professor of International Politics, Aberystwyth University.<br><br>Fredrik Logevall is Professor of History at Cornell University.A landmark study that takes a remarkably fresh approach to the Cold War, asking not only how it began or ended but why it lasted so long. The answer--that the U.S.-Soviet confrontation was perpetuated largely by the imperatives of American electoral politics and an ever expanding military-industrial complex--demands the serious attention of anyone interested in global affairs, past or present. Craig and Logevall remind us that American foreign policy is decided as much by domestic pressures as external threats. <i>America's Cold War</i> is history at its provocative best. (Mark Atwood Lawrence, author of <i>The Vietnam War: A Concise International History</i>)<br><br>Much ink has been spilled on the history of the Cold War, but Craig and Logevall have written a wholly new and original book. In beautiful, compelling prose, <i>America's Cold War</i> unearths the inner dynamic of American foreign policy by highlighting its intimate but hidden links with both domestic politics and economics. With its revealing insights into the partisan political influence upon U.S. foreign policy, this brilliant book offers a timely reminder that politics doesn't always stop at the water's edge. (Andrew Preston, author of <i>The War Council: McGeorge Bundy, the NSC, and Vietnam</i>)<br><br>A refreshingly incisive analysis of U.S. foreign policy during its long struggle with the Soviet Union. Craig and Logevall show how the interplay of structural forces and domestic politics led U.S. leaders to consistently exaggerate foreign threats, leading to costly misadventures that squandered much blood and treasure and inflicted considerable harm on other countries. Their judgments are subtle and balanced, the writing is clear and concise, and the implications for today's leaders are profound. (Stephen M. Walt, author of <i>Taming American Power</i>)<br><br>In this beautifully incisive and important reinterpretation of U.S. foreign relations history, Craig and Logevall demonstrate why Cold War America could never shake its own insecurity complex. It is a must read, not simply for understanding U.S. national security in the second half of the twentieth century, but for insight into why the politics of insecurity persist. (Timothy Naftali, coauthor of <i>One Hell of a Gamble</i>)<br><br>Craig and Logevall compellingly argue that the American experience in the Cold War must be understood in terms of the interplay between domestic and international politics. American history, political culture, and raw partisanship shaped attitudes and responses just as encounters with the USSR affected internal politics, economy, and society. This is an important book that will be read for years to come. (Robert Jervis, author of <i>American Foreign Policy in a New Era</i>)<br><br>This is a creative, carefully researched, and incisive analysis of U.S. strategy during the long struggle against the Soviet Union. There are plenty of good books on this topic already, but Craig and Logevall's is one of the best, and their interpretation has important implications for contemporary strategic debates. (Stephen M. Walt <i>foreignpolicy.com</i> 2009-10-27)<br><br>It is an excellent history, providing the best treatment of the question, "Who ended the Cold War, Reagan or Gorbachev?" (H. Nelsen <i>Choice</i> 2010-05-01)<br><br>Campbell Craig and Fredrik Logevall accomplish something amazing: in a mere 370 pages of text they present a cogent, well-written, highly informative, yet accessible narrative of the forty-five-year history of the Cold War...Together they bring a level of expertise to more facets of the Cold War than the vast majority of single-authored works could possibly emulate...There is much to applaud in this work and the authors will, I am sure, reap many accolades because of it. Due to its brevity and jargon-free writing style the book will be especially useful for undergraduates as well as the general public, but even specialists will find it worth reading.

His mythic title is Mabon, but his identities are many-including Arthur the King, whose coming we await. So says the mythic Welsh text the Mabinogion, which includes some of the oldest magical stories from British mythology and which has been intriguing and beguiling readers for centuries. <br><br>In <i>Mabon and the Guardians of Celtic Britain</i>, Celtic scholar Caitl�n Matthews unlocks the encoded meanings of the <i>Mabinogion</i> and establishes it firmly as a precursor to other living myths of the West. From her fascinating study of these stories emerge two of the major figures of the Celtic tradition: the archetypal Mabon, deliverer and liberator of the land, and Modron, his mother, the Great Goddess herself. The initiatory pattern of Britain's inner guardians is revealed through the succession of the Pendragons, as each rises through the ages from boy, hero, and king to the role of Mabon. As descendants of the ancient Celtic oral tradition, the rich themes and archetypal underpinnings of the <i>Mabinogion</i> are stories for all time.</p><p>Caitl�n Matthews is internationally renowned for her research into the Celtic and ancestral traditions. She is the author of 36 books, including <i>The Celtic Tradition, The Encyclopedia of Celtic Wisdom</i>, and <i>Sophia: Goddess of Wisdom</i>.

Within the castle grounds the timeless stories which form the Four Branches of the Mabinogion are being presented by a bilingual team of actors, musicians, and storytellers. They are but the most recent in a long line of storytellers who have helped transmit the Mabinogion from oral and written tradition to the imagination of new generations. The audience goes home in possession of a few fragments of a once mighty mystery tradition in which men and women encounter the gods, animals talk, leaves become gold, and the dead revive. A few may try to read the Mabinogion for themselves, puzzled, intrigued, and excited by the elusive hints which seem to dodge behind the main story just when revelation seems near. Many readers experience the same mixed emotions. <br> In order to untangle the complexity of the Mabinogion, it is necessary to understand that its stories arise directly from a lively oral tradition which, though it has parallels with the European chivalric cycles, ultimately derives from the folk traditions and mystery lore of Britain. It is the descendant of a venerable bardic tradition in which stories, poems, history, and ancestral lore were preserved in a professional though unwritten manner. We know from classical and Celtic sources that druids, poets, and storytellers taught their skills orally: They were never written down, although different forms of writing were in fact available.71 <br> Why trouble to memorize the equivalent of a small library at all, it may be asked? To understand this we must realize that in the time of this tradition, one&#x2019;s word was one&#x2019;s honor; it still had the currency of authority, and learned and unlearned alike were equal under its wisdom. The oral education of Celtic society included all levels of learning: legal, genealogical, historical, prophetic, and religious&#x2014;facets which are reflected in the Mabinogion itself and which put it outside modern categories of literature. But where once the druidic class had preserved the spiritual mysteries, in Christian times the ancient lore became the purview of the poet and storyteller. While this tradition was preserved freshly in many memories, as time wore on it began to lose touch with its roots. This is how we can distinguish traces of older belief within the stories which have come down to us. <br> The poet and the storyteller, who once shared professional status with the druid-kind (a class itself deriving from ancient shamanic tradition71) and preserved the old stories, slipped ever farther apart. The poet, or pencerdd, is represented in &#x201c;The Dream of Rhonabwy&#x201d; as chanting a eulogy which only another poet could understand; poetry had become technically arduous, its subtleties lost on the listener. Noblemen in Wales retained such poets in their households well into late medieval times in order to eulogize their family and achievements and relate the complex genealogies by which the poet&#x2019;s lord might trace his bloodline to legendary kings. A pencerdd might not sing for common men; his fee was a high one, entitling him to honor and position. It is bards such as these--with an eye to the moneybags rather than their craft--that Taliesin satirizes so cruelly: &#x201c;They sing vain and evanescent song.&#x201d;2 <br> For ordinary mortals, a teuluwr, or household poet, might suffice, a bard who would sing in the lower hall while his superior, the pencerdd, sang to his lord and lady in the upper hall. Less honored even than teuluwr, the clerwr, or wandering minstrel, was musician and storyteller to outlying homesteads, something like the poor scholar in &#x201c;Manawyddan, Son of Llyr,&#x201d; who comes from Lloegr, having begged his way: &#x201c;I come from England, Lord, from song making,&#x201d; but whose fees amount to a mere pound. <br> The cyfarwydd, or storyteller, may not have retained the status of the pencerdd, yet he never lost his popularity, for his stories were always accessible to his listeners. Like the Irish seanchai, the cyfarwydd had a store of tales which were handed down from master to pupil orally. Through such an oral tradition we receive the Mabinogion--a collection of stories which had been current for centuries before they came to be written down. Although each story has been given different emphases by different storytellers, the results are often remarkably consistent, as tell the scattered manuscripts from which the diplomatic edition of the Mabinogion is derived. Interestingly, errors crept into the stories when copyists lost interest in their weary task. As is revealed below, from one such error the word mabinogion is derived. <br> Set against the formalism of court poetry, the mutations of the stories give a lively variety and colloquialism to an ancient oral tradition. Just as in the Welsh language, in which initial consonants mutate or p becomes b, mh, or even ph, so the stories of the Mabinogion shine with a changing iridescence of forgotten tradition, hinting at significant episodes yet simultaneously obscuring them. It is true that we have inherited a pied tradition from storytellers who had lost many of the inner keys, though memory may yet recall portions which are lost or hopelessly tangled.</p><h2>History of the Mallory Family (History of S)</h2><p>History of the Mallory family</p><p></p><h2>Think Big: Quilts, Runners, and Pillows from 18&#34; Blocks</h2><p><p>From best-selling author Amy Ellis, this collection features 10 original graphic blocks incorporated into 24 fabulous projects for home decor.

But Vickrey's concerns are distinctly twentieth-century in the subjects and themes he has chosen, from childhood innocence to the dichotomy of urban versus country living. A quintessential Realist, Vickrey endeavoured to explore the human condition within a distinctively American environment, writes author Philip Eliasoph, whose essay argues that Vickrey's work builds a bridge from Surrealism and New Objectivity to Magic Realism.

Beginning in the Americas, Warman depicts corn as colonizer. Disparaged by the conquistadors, this Native American staple was embraced by the destitute of the Old World.

By the author of I Would Steal Horses. 25,000 first printing. National ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>Alexie is a poet, novelist, and screenwriter. He has won the Pen/Faulkner Award, Stranger Genius Award in Literature,<i> Boston Globe</i>-Horn Book Award for Excellence in Children&#x2019;s Literature, and the Malamud Award.With wrenching pain and wry humor, the talented Alexie, a Spokane/Coeur d'Alene Indian--and previously a small-press author (The Business of Fancydancing, a collection of poetry and prose-- not reviewed--etc.)--presents contemporary life on the Spokane Indian Reservation through 22 linked stories. Here, people treat each other (and life) with amused tolerance--although anger can easily erupt in this environment of endemic alcoholism and despair. The history of defeat is ever- present; every attempt to hold onto cultural tradition aches with poignancy: Thomas-Builds-the-Fire is the storyteller everyone mocks and no one listens to; Aunt Nezzy, who sews a traditional full- length beaded dress that turns out to be too heavy to wear, believes that the woman ``who can carry the weight of this dress on her back...will save us all.'' Meanwhile, young men dream of escape--going to college, being a basketball star--but failure seems preordained. These tales, though sad and at times plain- spokenly didactic, are often lyrically beautiful and almost always very funny. Chapters focus on and are narrated by several different characters, but voices and perspectives often become somewhat indistinguishable--confusing until you stop worrying about who is speaking and choose to listen to the voice of the book itself and enter into its particular sensibility. Irony, grim humor, and forgiveness help characters transcend pain, anger and loss while the same qualities make it possible to read Alexie's fiction without succumbing to hopelessness. Forgiveness seems to be the last moral/ethical value left standing: the ability both to judge and to love gives the book its searing yet affectionate honesty.

Shortly after World War One, Steinn Elli�i, a young philosopher-poet dandy, leaves the physical and cultural confines of Iceland&#x2019;s shores for mainland Europe, seeking to become "the most perfect man on earth." His journey leads us through a huge range of moral, philosophical, religious, political, and social realms, from hedonism to socialism to aestheticism to Benedictine monasticism, exploring, as Laxness puts it, "the far-ranging variety in the life of a soul, with the swings on a pendulum oscillating between angel and devil." Upon his return to Iceland, Steinn finds himself more conflicted than before, torn between love of the beauty and traditions of his homeland, longing and regret for his great adolescent love, Dilj�, and his newfound monastic ideal, forcing him to make choices with fateful consequences. The Great Weaver from Kashmir&nbsp;is as much a domestic parlor drama as it is a novel of ideas; it can be seen as the downward spiral of an antihero or an exploration of idealism and loss; it is at once an inward-looking and daring early novel and a modern epic spun by a superior craftsman. Published when Laxness was only twenty-five years old,&nbsp;The Great Weaver from Kashmir&#x2019;s radical experimentation created a stir in Iceland. Appearing in English now for the first time,&nbsp;The Great Weaver is much more than a first major work by a literary master&#x2014;it is a remarkable modernist classic written literally on the cultural and geographical fringes of modern Europe.</p><p>Halld�r Laxness&nbsp;(1902-1998) is the undisputed master of modern Icelandic fiction. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1955 "for his vivid epic power which has renewed the great narrative art of Iceland." His body of work includes novels, essays, poems, plays, stories, and memoirs: more than sixty books in all. His works available in English include&nbsp;Independent People, The Fish Can Sing, World Light, Under the Glacier, Iceland's Bell, and&nbsp;Paradise Reclaimed. Philip Roughton&#x2019;s translation of&nbsp;Iceland's Bell&nbsp;received the American-Scandinavian Foundation Translation Prize in 2001 and second prize in the 2000 BCLA John Dryden Translation Competition. His translation of Halld�r Gu�mundsson&#x2019;s&nbsp;The Islander: A Biography of Halld�r Laxness&nbsp;was recently released in the United Kingdom.Once two swans flew overhead, eastward.<br><br> The world is like a stage where everything has been set up for an extravagant musical: the fragrance of birchwood in the lava fields at �ingvellir,2 cold gusts of wind from S�lur, violet light in the Esja sky, the azure deep and cold over Skjaldbrei�ur, but darkness no longer descends.

Story moves us to love and hate and can motivate us to change the whole course of our lives. Story can lift us beyond our individual borders to imagine the realities of other people, times, and places. Storytelling �&#x20ac;&#x201d; both oral tradition and written word �&#x20ac;&#x201d; is the foundation of being human. In this powerful book, Christina Baldwin, one of the visionaries who started the personal writing movement, explores the vital necessity of re-creating a sacred common ground for each other's stories. Each chapter in Storycatcher is carried by a fascinating narrative �&#x20ac;&#x201d; about people, family, or community �&#x20ac;&#x201d; intertwined with practical instruction about the nature of story, how it works, and how we can practice it in our lives. Whether exploring the personal stories revealed in our private journals, the stories of family legacy, the underlying stories that drive our organizations, or the stories that define our personal identity, Christina's book encourages us all to become storycatchers �&#x20ac;&#x201d; and shows us how new stories lay the framework for a new world.</p><p>A 2005 Books for a Better Life award winner<br> A <i>Spirituality &amp; Health</i> Best Spiritual Book of 2005<br> A One Spirit Book Club alternate selection<br> A Writer's Digest Book Club selection<br> <br> "As a television journalist, I know the incredible power of story to connect people and issues, and <i>Storycatcher</i> reminds us how essential it is to speak our truth in the world.

The book integrates her wisdom and experience in group process and teaching with her skill as an exceptional storyteller and writer. I enjoyed her stories, but I also felt they were expertly used to demonstrate the various points she was making about the storycatching process. Her arguments for group-based story work as a process for self-awareness, but, equally important, as a form of social activism, are absolutely incontrovertible.

"ALL this hammering away on a hot computer keyboard.""Productive hammering, my love," I said, pushing away my own keyboard, yawning and stretching until my joints cracked. "In a little under two hours we have made more than two hundred thousand credits through insider dealing in the stock exchange. Some might believe it illegal--but very profitable. I prefer to see it as a public service. To keep the money circulating, to lower the level of unemployment ...""Not now, Jim. I am too tired to listen.""But not too tired to listen to this. Right now we need a complete change. What do you say to a picnic in a leafy dell in Sharwood Forest? With champagne.""A lovely idea, but the shopping ...""Has been already done. I have a complete picnic, basket and all, in the stasis freezer. Everything from caviar to Roc's eggs. We have but to sling it into the hoverfloat, along with plenty of bubbly drink, and let joy begin."And so it did. While Angelina slipped into something picnicky, I slipped the picnic hamper into the hoverfloat--humming happily as I did so for we had been working too hard of late. We must escape the daily grind. A change of scenery. Inthe nearby forest, which was one of the few green spots on the painfully boring planet of Usti nad Labam. The landscape was all dark satanic techno-factories run by computer nerds. It was a pleasure to rob them. Using the most advanced hacking techniques I had slipped some software into the operating system of a prominent broker. With this I could slow their input of information by varying lengths of time. With this advance knowledge I could buy before a price rise--then sell at the higher price. Neat.A favor to them really, because when the scam was eventually discovered, I truly believe that the resultant news stories and jolly police chases would give them something to think about for a change. Instead of the incessant RAM, ROM, PROM. In our own way Angelina and I were benefactors, bringing joy into otherwise boring lives. The price was a small one for them. Infinitesimal. Angelina joined me and we were up, up and away.The engine roared forcefully, the air rushed by swiftly, and we held hands compassionately as our transport of delight soared skyward."Wonderful," Angelina breathed.<i>"Merda,"</i> I growled as a police warning bleeped and blinked on the console. There it was--a police cruiser swooping towards us. I stamped hard on the power."Please don't," Angelina said, placing a gentle hand on my arm. "Let us not spoil the day with a sizzling chase. Could we just stop, smile at the police? Not you, me. All you have to do is pay the fine. I will charm the police, you pay their fine, and we will then go on."It made sense. There was no point in spoiling our day out before it really started. I sighed dramatically and, with great reluctance, eased off.Our speed dropped.The police cruiser fired its nose guns at us.Things happened very quickly after that.I hit overdrive and pulled back hard into an inside loop.The police missed: I didn't. I blew the cruiser's tail off. Then I banked hard to avoid the hosing slugs from his wingman. As the police vehicle swooped by I saw that it had no windows. Therefore no occupants."Robot policemen!" I chortled. "Therefore we don't have to hold back and spare their lives. Because they have no lives! To the junkyard with the lot!"After that it was Old Home Week in the diGriz partnership. I climbed--then did a 5G dive to get away from the flock of police cruisers that had appeared all too suddenly. Hit the reverse drive when they were all on my tail. Angelina worked the armament and defenses as they zipped by and managed to get three of them. Even on the most peaceful planet I go not unarmed into the sky; our peaceful hoverfloat was a lot more deadly than it looked.But this chase was beginning to turn nasty. We were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. "And running out of ammo," Angelina said, echoing my own thoughts."Change of venue!" I shouted, dropping towards the green forest below. "Grab the survival kit and get ready for a bumpy landing."I screeched low over a rock-tipped ridge, dived into the valley beyond--and braked to a hover under the trees below. Angelina had the door open as we juddered to a stop, the kit thrown out, and was diving right out behind it when I hit the two-second-delay button. I was cutting it a little too close: the doorframe hit my bootheel as I went out. I changed the dive into a roll, hit the ground hard on my shoulders and thudded to a stop, all of the air knocked out of me."My hero," my dear wife said, patting my eheek and kissing my forehead. "Now let's move it."We did. Grabbing up the kit, she gracefully, and I haltingly, dived into the protection of the shrubbery.Meanwhile above the trees the battle roared as our faithful hoverfloat defended itself with all the robotic skill at its command. Alas, the fracas ended suddenly with a tremendous explosion."End of champagne and caviar," Angelina said, her voice so cold I felt my body temperature drop."I'll not contribute to the Policeman's Ball this year." I grimaced.She laughed warmly and squeezed my hand. And the old, cold deadly Angelina slipped away."Let's make tracks," I said. "Before they discover that they were fighting the robot pilot.""Let us not," she said. "This is a nice big tree that we are under. It will shield us from visual observation, perhaps infrared imaging as well. If they suspect that we were not in the hoverfloat they could backtrack and look for us.""Your logic is impeccable," I said, rooting through the survival kit. Guns, grenades, all the necessities of life. "And to carry that logic a bit further--why were the police trying to shoot us up?""I haven't the foggiest. As far as the authorities know we are simple tourists who dabble in the market. Sometimes losing ...""Most times winning!""What do you have there?" she asked as I pulled a silver form out from behind a belt of ammunition."Jolly Barman Instant Cocktails. I bought a couple of these on sale." I pulled the tab and two plastic beakers dropped into my hand. There was a hissing sound and the can turned cold in my hand; moisture condensed on it. I handed Angelina a beaker, poured it full of sparkling liquid. The gray scraps in the bottoms of the mugs were instantly reconstituted by the liquid to pieces of fruit. I poured another drink for myself and we sipped appreciatively."Not too bad." I smacked my lips and cudgeled my brain. "Those police were out to blast us--not arrest us. Are we missing something?""Obviously. I think that we should get out of the forest now and see what we can find out about this mystery attack.""We can't exactly call the police and ask them why they were gunning for us--can we?""We can't. Therefore I will think of something more subtle. Call our son James and have him do a computer search of our problem. After at!--he is in the computer business here and should know how to get information.""An excellent idea. We can also have him come pick us up since it is a long walk home."We finished the drinks and I shouldered the survival kit. There was no sound of aircraft now, just some distant birdcalls and the hum of insects. We moved through the trees, staying undercover, distancing ourselves from the action with the police fleet. We listened closely but there was no sound of any engines behind or above us. I smiled. Then I frowned when I heard the grumble of a motor up ahead."Perhaps that is a sturdy forester, practicing his weald-wise trade," I said hopefully."Would that it were. Because whatever it is out there is coming closer. If they are looking for us, then I am forced to believe that all of this activity and attention is far too murderous for a simple traffic bust.""Unhappily, I agree. They have made no attempt to communicate with us--just came in blasting."I looked on gloomily as she opened the survival kit and took out an immense handgun. "But let us not make it easy for them."We didn't. The armored police cruiser had its tracks blow off as it appeared. It kept firing at us even though it couldn't move. We dived in close, so close it could not depress its guns to get at us. I jumped to the top of the tread, flipped open the top hatch and dropped a couple of sleep capsules. Then I looked carefully inside."Highly interesting." I rejoined Angelina on the ground. "Nobody home. Which means, like the cruisers that chased us, this thing is also robot operated and remotely controlled.""By whom?""By our new enemies, whoever they are."Distant engines sounded from behind the trees and we slipped away in the opposite direction, deeper into the forest. Which did not do much good in the end because there were now sounds of machines from ahead."They have trackers on us--so there is no point in wearying ourselves by running about. We'll stay here and make a stand. Get as many of these robot machines as we can.""I thought that there were laws of robotics--about not killing or injuring humans.""It looks like those laws were repealed. Lock and load--here they come again!"I would have felt a certain compunction about killing a policeman, but I really did enjoy blasting police robots into tiny bits of junk. But it proved to be a no-win battle. Wherever we turned they were there ahead of us. Our ammunition dwindled as their numbers increased."My last grenade," Angelina said as she blasted a hovertank."My last shot," I said, taking out a robocycle. "It has been nice knowing you.""Nonsense, Jim. You are not giving up, you never do, never will.""You know that--but they don't." I stepped out into the clearing and waved my handkerchief, raised my palms in the air as I faced the circle of robot police. "Peace, pax, surrender. OK?""No OK," an armored robot said. It had sergeant's stripes welded to its arm, and a sneering tone to its metallic voice.It raised a glowing muzzled flamethrower.I blew it away with a shot from my crotch cannon.Was this the end? Were we to be ground into the soil of this sordid planet at the galaxy's edge?The tanks and robots and all the other military gear surrounded us, rumbled forward, weapons quivering with metallic malice. Angelina had her hand in mine. I contemplated one lastattack, throwing myself onto our attackers in the vain hope that she might escape. Then, even as I tensed my muscles for a suicidal attack, a voice sounded out from among the trees."You really are very good," the dapper man said condescendingly as he stepped into the glade. Full evening dress, black cloak held by a diamond brooch, diamond-capped cane. This was too much. I heard a primitive, unsummoned growl grumble from the back of my throat as I fired what really was the very last shot from my crotch cannon.It exploded with a glare of flame, a blast of noise.Just in front of him. Spending all of its energy harmlessly against the force screen emanating from his walking stick."Temper, temper," he breathed, covering a yawn with the back of his hand. He waved the ebony cane in a slight arc and all of the weaponry grumbled back into the forest and vanished from sight."You are not the police," Angelina said."Anything but, Mrs. diGriz. Those were my minions who took you on. My employees, so to speak. Their ranks are now well decimated I must add.""Tough," I said. "Call your insurance company. Remember--you started it.""I did indeed, and am well satisfied by the outcome. I have heard from many sources that you were the best man--and best lady of course--in your chosen profession. I found that hard to believe. But now I do. Most impressive. So impressive that I am prepared to offer you a little assignment.""I am not for hire. Who are you?""Oh, I think you are. Imperetrix Von Kaiser-Czarski. You may call me Kaizi.""Good-by, Kaizi," I sneered, taking Angelina's hand and turning away."One million credits a day. Plus expenses.""Two million," I said, turning back, all sneering spent."Done. We will both sign this." A gold-embellished contract on finest vellum unrolled from his walking stick and hepassed it over to me. Angelina leaned over my shoulder and we read it together."Any problems?" Kaizi asked."None," I answered. "We undertake to undertake an assignment at the agreed fee, payment to be deposited daily to my account. Fine. But what is it that you want us to do?"Kaizi sighed and touched his stick again. It opened up into a comfortable-looking folding seat and he settled into it."To begin with, you must realize my position, understand exactly who I am. You have never heard of me because I prefer it that way. If only to avoid the people with their hands out, eagerly seeking some of my money. I am, to put it simply, the richest man in the galaxy." He smiled slightly as he spoke. Undoubtedly thinking of all the money he had."I am probably the oldest man as well. The last time I worked out the figures, I think it was forty thousand years, give or take a millennium or two. As I am sure you realize, one's memory begins to glitch a bit as the centuries roll by. I was a scientist, rather I <i>think</i> that I was a scientist. Or perhaps I hired a scientist. In any case I developed the first longevity drug. That much I am sure of. Which I, of course, kept to myself. And have been improving it ever since. How old do you think I look?"He raised his chin and turned his head. No wattles there. No wrinkles about his eyes, no touch of gray to his temple."Forty, I would say," Angelina said."Centuries?""Years.""You are very kind. Well, as the millennia rolled by I amassed more money, more property. I could have easily assured my fortune by simply investing and letting the compound interest roll in. But that would have been very boring, and boredom is what I loathe the most. I have always sought excitement to lessen the burden of my years. In the process of growing rich I have bought, and now own, entire star systems. To add diversity to my portfolio I am presently in the processof acquiring a spiral galaxy; one never knows when one might need one. There are some black holes among my recent acquisitions. But I think I shall divest myself of them. Boring. Seen one black hole and you have seen them all."He took the kerchief from his breast pocket, touched it lightly to his lips, returned it. One atom short of a molecule, I thought. I caught Angelina's eye and saw that she thought the same."But now I have a very troublesome problem that needs to be solved. I look for your aid in that quest.""Three million a day," I said promptly, avarice beating down suspicion."Done," he said, stifling a yawn at the same time. "My problem is that I am systematically being robbed. Someone--or some group--has been getting into my bank accounts. Right across the galaxy. Clearing them out. And if it so happens that I happen to own the bank--The Widows and Orphans 1st Interstellar Bank--why then the entire branch of the bank is c...</p><h2>To Offer Compassion: A History of the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion</h2><p>In 1967, when abortion was either illegal or highly restricted in every U.S. state, a group of ministers and rabbis formed to counsel women with unwanted pregnancies&#x2015;including referral to licensed physicians willing to perform the procedure. By 1973, when the Roe v. Wade court decision made abortion legal nationwide, the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion (CCS) had spread from coast to coast, referred hundreds of thousands of women for safe abortions without a single fatality, become a medical consumer advocacy group, and opened its own clinic in New York City.<br><br>As religious leaders spoke out on issues of civil rights, peace, or poverty, CCS members were also called to action by the suffering of women who had approached them for help. Overwhelmingly male, white, affluent, and middle-aged, these mainline Protestant and Jewish clergy were nonetheless outspoken advocates for the rights of women, particularly poor women. <i>To Offer Compassion</i> is a detailed history of this unique and largely forgotten movement, drawing on extensive interviews with original participants and on primary documents from the CCS's operations.</p><p>Why Christian and Jewish clergy were frontline advocates for abortion rights in the 1960sDoris Andrea Dirks is a senior academic planner with the University of Wisconsin System Administration.

The threat comes from the fourth branch of government&#x2014;the biggest branch&#x2014;and the only branch not in the Constitution: the federal bureaucracy. The bureaucracy imposes thousands of new laws every year, without a single vote from Congress. The bureaucracy violates the rights of Americans without accountability&#x2014;persecuting adoptive parents, denying veterans quality healthcare, discriminating against conservatives and Christians for partisan purposes, and damaging our economy with job-killing rules.<br> <br>Americans are bullied by the very institutions established to protect their right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.<br> <br>Our nation&#x2019;s bureaucrats are on an undemocratic power trip.<br> <br>But Jay has a plan to fight back. We can resist illegal abuse, we can reform a broken system, and we can restore American democracy. This book won&#x2019;t just tell you how to win, it will show you real victories achieved by Jay and the American Center for Law and Justice.<br> <br>Unless we can roll back the fourth branch of govern�ment&#x2014;the most dangerous branch&#x2014;our elections will no longer matter. <i>Undemocratic</i> is a wake-up call, a call made at just the right time&#x2014;before it&#x2019;s too late to save the democracy we love.</p><p>Jay Sekulow&nbsp;is widely regarded as one of the foremost free speech and religious liberties litigators in the United States, having argued twelve times before the US Supreme Court in some of the most groundbreaking First Amendment cases of the past quarter century. As chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), he is a renowned constitutional attorney, an international expert on religious liberty, and an acclaimed and distinguished broadcaster. Jay is a passionate advocate for protecting religious and constitutional freedoms with an impressive track record of success. His steadfast determination and commitment to protecting these freedoms is expansive with his work resulting in a lasting impact across America and around the world. He is a member of President Donald Trump&#x2019;s legal team, and he is also a popular talk radio host and&nbsp;regularly appears on major media, including Fox News, CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, and other outlets.Undemocratic 1<p></p> ONE DAY IN MAY<p></p> <br>I have a unique vantage point from my office in Washington, D.C. My building, in the heart of Capitol Hill, is directly across the street from the Supreme Court of the United States. The Justices literally drive by my office each day that the court is in session. From my window I can see the chambers where the Justices and law clerks spend their days crafting legal opinions that impact all of us. There have been many nights when I have seen the glow of the lights emanating from those chambers as the final touches are put in place. It is an awe-inspiring location. From the white marble columns on the exterior to the expansive courtroom where the oral arguments take place, the building represents power and stability. One of the most impressive aspects of the building is the depiction of great lawgivers carved into the marble. Each time I enter the courtroom, I glance up at those lawgivers, including Moses holding the Ten Commandments written in Hebrew.<br> <br>For three decades I have had the privilege of arguing cases before the Supreme Court representing a wide range of legal issues including: religious liberty, prayer and Bible clubs in public schools, free speech, and defending the unborn&#x2019;s fundamental right to life, and campaign finance reform. I even argued a case before the Supreme Court involving the Ten Commandments Monument in Utah. My team and I won 9&#x2013;0. Admittedly, it is one of my favorite cases, as I was able to reference the Supreme Court building&#x2019;s own depiction of Moses holding the Ten Commandments.<br> <br>The judiciary, our third branch of government, is powerful. After all, the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution and that impacts each of us. It is not, however, the most powerful branch. From my office, I also have a great view of the Capitol dome. I have often taken guests up to the top floor of our building to view the Capitol. The lit dome in the evening sends the clear message that legislators are handling serious business. The Senate office buildings are just across the street from the front door to my building. In fact, after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the security perimeter was moved directly in front of our offices. When the anthrax attack took place days after 9/11, the surveillance devices and air monitoring equipment were placed just a few feet from our main entrance. The security in the area is still very tight, as it should be&#x2014;these are the buildings that house our legislature, our second branch of government. This branch represents the people, and it&#x2019;s where our laws are constructed. And yet, as powerful as the legislative branch of government is, it is not the most powerful branch.<br> <br>I can hop into a cab and after a short five-minute drive I am at the White House. I have had the incredible privilege of being in the Oval Office, discussing major issues with President Bush, ranging from judicial nominations to terrorism. It is an experience that is hard to put into words. When you are seated next to the president of the United States, the commander in chief of our armed forces, you realize quickly that what takes place in that office not only impacts each of us, the impact is felt around the globe. The executive branch of government and the president are powerful. There is no doubt about it. But I submit to you that the executive branch is not the most powerful.<br> <br>The most powerful branch of our government is located around the corner from the Supreme Court building, a few streets over from the Capitol, and a couple of blocks from the White House. These buildings are scattered around D.C. house agencies&#x2014;the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, the Labor Department, and many others. These agencies are run by bureaucrats. And these unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats destroy our liberty and threaten our democracy. We are in serious peril because of this&#x2014;the most powerful branch of government we did not even learn about in high school civics class.<br> <br>The problem is, the Constitution does not provide for a fourth branch of government. Yet we have one. We have created an unconstitutional, self-sustaining monster that is swallowing our democracy. Our constitutional republic hangs in the balance. I keep a diary with me where I note significant events in my legal practice. My entry on May 10, 2013, was a game changer.<br> <br>The first email&#x2014;marked &#x201c;URGENT&#x201d;&#x2014;hit my inbox at 10:17 a.m., just minutes before my radio program goes live on air. The message was simple: Lois Lerner, then the head of exempt organizations at the Internal Revenue Service, had &#x201c;apologized&#x201d; to conservative and Tea Party groups for intentionally subjecting them to heightened IRS scrutiny.<br> <br>My first feeling was vindication. More than a year earlier, dozens of Tea Party and other conservative groups had contacted me, all telling me the same story. The IRS was delaying their tax exemption applications and requiring them to answer&#x2014;under penalty of perjury&#x2014;appallingly broad questions, questions that violated the constitutional rights of American citizens.<br> <br>The IRS delayed at least one pro-life group because the agency subjectively determined1 that the group&#x2019;s &#x201c;presentations make substantial use of inflammatory and disparaging terms and express conclusions more on the basis of strong emotional feelings than of objective evaluations&#x201d;&#x2014;as if the liberal nonprofit organizations like Planned Parenthood or the American Civil Liberties Union don&#x2019;t make arguments &#x201c;on the basis of strong emotional feelings.&#x201d;<br> <br>We took the cases, notified the IRS of our representation, and publicly called on Congress to take action, by holding hearings to investigate IRS abuse. In response, the IRS denied all wrongdoing, and the mainstream media of course backed the Obama administration&#x2019;s taxing agency, with the New York Times even claiming that in scrutinizing the Tea Party, the IRS was merely doing its job.2<br> <br>But with Lois Lerner&#x2019;s apology, everything changed&#x2014;for a few days, anyway. Every major network carried the apology, every major newspaper wrote articles and analyses, and even President Barack Obama went to the White House podium and expressed his deep outrage.<br> <br>And the IRS&#x2019;s actions were outrageous. In fact, they were criminal. And, for a time, the Obama administration seemed to agree. Within days of the IRS&#x2019;s apology, Attorney General Eric Holder declared that the IRS&#x2019;s conduct was &#x201c;outrageous and unacceptable&#x201d; and ordered a criminal investigation.3<br> <br>The conduct of the IRS was, in fact, &#x201c;outrageous.&#x201d; Over a period of years, the IRS singled out conservative and pro-life individuals and organizations for extraordinary audits, unconstitutional questioning, years-long delays in processing applications, and selective leaks of private information.<br> <br>Ultimately, we discovered the IRS went so far as to try to collude with the Department of Justice to prosecute conservatives, to attempt to &#x201c;piece together&#x201d; (to borrow a term from an actual IRS email4) prosecutions of American citizens without a single shred of evidence or a single specific complaint of illegal activity.<br> <br>On May 10, we knew only part of the story, but we knew enough to know the IRS was out of control.<br> <br>Our work on several IRS cases revealed that before approving conservative groups for the same nonprofit status long granted to large liberal organizations like Planned Parenthood, MoveOn.org, and the ACLU, the IRS was not only delaying applications for years, it was asking questions that were themselves unconstitutional.<br> <br>� It wanted to know the names of children tutored by a constitutional education nonprofit.<br> <br>� The IRS wanted log-in information and passwords for conservative websites.<br> <br>� It wanted to know the identity of donors, even when the law allowed donors to remain anonymous.<br> <br>� It demanded to know the details of all communications between conservative nonprofits and any elected official, demanding even details of &#x201c;indirect&#x201d; communications (whatever those were).<br> <br>� It demanded an accounting of all the nonprofit work of even family members of Tea Party leaders, including their membership on church boards.5<br> <br>It attacked pro-life speech as &#x201c;propaganda,&#x201d; and it demanded to know the content even of pro-life prayers.<br> <br>And that was just the tip of the iceberg.<br> <br>My first job out of law school was in the Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service. My experience taught me that the IRS&#x2019;s attacks on the conservative movement went straight to the top of the agency. In her apology,6 Lois Lerner claimed that the misdeeds were the fault of &#x201c;line&#x201d; workers in Cincinnati&#x2014;low-level employees. But we had in our possession letters from IRS offices in California and in Washington, D.C. Some of these letters were signed by Lois Lerner herself.<br> <br>Lerner also implied that the IRS&#x2019;s wrongdoing had stopped, that when the agency learned what the low-level workers were doing, it called a halt to all improper activity.<br> <br>Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, even as Lois Lerner spoke, multiple conservative groups were still waiting for IRS approvals and continued to receive intrusive questions. Some are still waiting for approval years after the &#x201c;apology.&#x201d; For others, it took filing litigation in federal court to get the IRS to do the right thing.<br> <br>Even worse, the very day before she spoke, emails revealed that Lois Lerner was plotting with the Department of Justice and chief of staff of the IRS commissioner to criminally prosecute conservatives for violating tax laws&#x2014;even without any evidence that the laws had been violated.<br> <br>This misconduct was not some minor annoyance for conservatives. It was so widespread&#x2014;affecting every single conservative group that applied for nonprofit status&#x2014;and so egregious that scholars from the American Enterprise Institute argued it may have had a material impact on the 2012 election.7<br> <br>Writing for the AEI&#x2019;s online journal, Stan Veuger explained:<br> <br>The bottom line is that the Tea Party movement, when properly activated, can generate a huge number of votes&#x2014;more votes in 2010, in fact, than the vote advantage Obama held over Romney in 2012. The data show that had the Tea Party groups continued to grow at the pace seen in 2009 and 2010, and had their effect on the 2012 vote been similar to that seen in 2010, they would have brought the Republican Party as many as 5&#x2013;8.5 million votes compared to Obama&#x2019;s victory margin of 5 million.<br> <br>President Obama&#x2019;s margin of victory in some of the key swing states was fairly small: a mere 75,000 votes separated the two contenders in Florida, for example. That is less than 25% of our estimate of what the Tea Party&#x2019;s impact in Florida was in 2010. Looking forward to 2012 in 2010 undermining the Tea Party&#x2019;s efforts there must have seemed quite appealing indeed.8<br> <br>In other words, had the Tea Party continued its proportionate impact on Republican voting, it could have well made up the difference in key states. Instead it found itself under sustained assault from the IRS, an assault that had a real impact.<br> <br>Veuger goes on to explain how the IRS targeting choked off funds that would have gone to Republican candidates:<br> <br>As a consequence [of IRS targeting], the founders, members, and donors of new Tea Party groups found themselves incapable of exercising their constitutional rights, and the Tea Party&#x2019;s impact was muted in the 2012 election cycle. As Toby Marie Walker, who runs the Waco Tea Party, which filed for tax-exempt status in 2010 but didn&#x2019;t receive approval until two months ago, recounted recently: &#x201c;Our donors dried up. It was intimidating and time-consuming.&#x201d; The Richmond Tea Party went through a similar ordeal, and was only granted tax-exempt status in December, right after the election&#x2014;three years after its initial request. Its chairman explained the consequences: the episode cost the Richmond Tea Party $17,000 in legal fees and swallowed time the all-volunteer network would have devoted to voter turnout, outreach in black and Latino neighborhoods and other events to highlight the constitution and &#x201c;the concept of liberty.&#x201d;9<br> <br>The bottom line? A rogue IRS may well have helped keep Barack Obama in the White House. In fact, Lois Lerner in an infamous email said she had hoped to get a job with President Obama&#x2019;s reelection campaign.<br> <br>There is much more to say about this scandal later, but I raise it now to explain a deeply troubling reality, a reality that is shaking our American democracy to its foundations, a reality that could mean the end of American exceptionalism, an end to the concept of American self-government intended by our Founders and lived through our citizens for almost 240 years.<br> <br>When the IRS scandal broke, my phone seemed to ring for days straight. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever gotten as much email before or since. And there was one question that was on everyone&#x2019;s lips: &#x201c;What did the president know and when did he know it?&#x201d;<br> <br>In other words, the scandal was viewed through the prism of Watergate, the legendary scandal that ended the Nixon presidency, with the assumption that it was only truly &#x201c;real,&#x201d; only truly important, if it could bring down the president of the United States.<br> <br>But I was more disturbed by a different thought, a concern that transcends the current occupant of the White House:<br> <br>What if the IRS&#x2014;arguably the nation&#x2019;s most powerful domestic agency&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t actually need a presidential directive to engage in its nationwide persecution of conservatives? What if the IRS acted largely on its own initiative to target Americans, harass them, audit them, humiliate them, and try to prosecute them merely because the IRS disagreed with their political beliefs?<br> <br>That is a much larger problem than the corruption of a single agency. That is the corruption of an entire system of government.<br> <br>And that is the theme of this book.<br> <br>While Americans have been robustly engaged in political debates&#x2014;and participating in vast numbers in elections&#x2014;a new branch of government has been growing in the shadows. A branch that is elected by no one, ignored by the media, protected by the courts and by a complex web of laws and regulations: with job security so great that some federal employees are more likely to die on the job than they are to be fired.<br> <br>This new branch of government&#x2014;personified not just by the IRS but by the entire array of federal agencies, like the Department of Justice, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal Communications Commission, and many others&#x2014;is the federal bureaucracy; it possesses a staggering amount of power, and it is not only increasingly partisan, it is increasingly corrupt and incompetent.<br> <br>Imagine if Congress wrote and enacted far more laws than it does now, but you could never vote the lawmakers out of office.<br> <br>You don&#x2019;t have to imagine it. It&#x2019;s happening.<br> <br>Imagine if congressmen were systematically corrupt, abused their power, and demonstrated rank incompetence, but by law they never had to face the voters.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s our bureaucracy.<br> <br>Imagine if a congressman, once in office, was allowed to hold power until death or retirement, whichever came first.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s our b...</p><h2>The Crying of Lot 49</h2><p><em>The Crying of Lot 49</em> is the classic novel of conspiracy and self-knowledge by the legendary Thomas Pynchon, now available in an Olive Edition&#x2014;a lower-priced small format edition with a hip and beautiful package design. <em>The Crying of Lot 49</em> is the story of Oedipa Maas, a woman who finds herself enmeshed in a worldwide conspiracy, meets some extremely interesting characters, and attains a not inconsiderable amount of self knowledge.</p><p><p>The highly original satire about Oedipa Maas, a woman who finds herself enmeshed in a worldwide conspiracy, meets some extremely interesting characters, and attains a not inconsiderable amount of self knowledge.</p><p>Thomas Pynchon was born in 1937.

I dreamed of finding happiness in love. The only difference between the average girl and myself was that I set about making my dreams come true.&#x201d;1 <br>Gloria always lived by her own beliefs. She once stated quite emphatically, &#x201c;I feel sure that unborn babies pick their parents.&#x201d;2 She never believed anything was accidental. By that same reasoning, babies probably also pick where they are born. For Gloria, it was in Chicago, Illinois. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The 1890 U.S. Census reported the nation&#x2019;s Swedish population to be over 800,000 (causing a major concern in Sweden, as its national population had begun to dwindle). Most Swedish immigrants were young and unmarried Lutherans. Primarily they were farmers. Yet some settled in urban communities such as Chicago&#x2019;s &#x201c;Swede Town,&#x201d; adopting new trades to earn enough money to eventually buy farms. In 1900, Chicago could boast of being the world&#x2019;s fifth-largest city, a large percentage of its population being of German, Irish, Swedish, and Polish decent. By 1910, the city supported 407 movie houses, twice more per capita than New York City. <br>Whereas Swedish immigration was fueled by economic opportunity, Polish immigration was ignited by cultural suppression, brought on by an age of industrialization, turning many peasant Polish farmers into migrant workers. By 1900, Chicago and its suburbs were home to one of the largest Polish American communities in the country. One could not walk down a city block without hearing Polish spoken. <br>Into this melting pot was born Gloria Swanson. Her Swedish-Lutheran paternal grandfather was Jons (Americanized to James or John) Peter Swanson, a shoemaker born in November 1849 in Vastina (Sm�land), Sweden.3 Jons and his wife Johanna (nee Schoberg) had immigrated to Chicago with John&#x2019;s younger brother Carl Albert. The family resided in Chicago&#x2019;s 11th District on West Elizabeth Street. Jons and Johanna would have a total of thirteen children, according to Gloria, including her aunt May and two uncles, Charles and Jonathan. <br>Joseph Theodore, the oldest of their sons, was born in Chicago in November 1874. He met Adelaide M. Klanowski, born July 15, 1878, in the summer of 1897.4 Adelaide, called Addie, was the daughter of saloonkeeper and shoemaker Herman Klanowski, born in Prussia in 1849, and his wife Bertha May (one of another thirteen children), who was born in Baden-Baden, Germany, in 1856. <br>Gloria&#x2019;s great-grandfather May came to America in 1852. His house on LaSalle Street burned to the ground during the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, and the family lost everything. After their marriage in the 1880s Herman and Bertha resided on Clark Street with Bertha&#x2019;s sister Clara. The family later moved to 213 Ashland Avenue around the turn of the century. Herman and Bertha had two sons, Edward, born January 1873, and Herman Jr., born in 1877. After granddaughter Gloria was born, Bertha divorced Herman Klanowski and remarried a pleasant fellow named Mr. Lew, by whom she had a daughter named Lola. <br>Joseph T. Swanson was a handsome, lean, and restless man with blue eyes. He had once worked for a local politician, but found politics not his m�tier. He became a civilian clerk attached to the Army Transport Service. (Later, after serving in Europe during the Great War, he was given the rank of captain.) On January 4, 1898, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Joseph Swanson married Addie Klanowski. <br>Addie was not well educated. And because she was a bit of a romantic, she chose marriage over life as a Polish working girl, which usually meant toiling in restaurants, laundries, or the garment district. Joseph and Addie moved to a two-story wooden frame house located at 150 Seminary Avenue in Chicago soon after their marriage.5 On the first Monday of Holy Week, March 27, 1899, their only child, a girl, was born.6 The attending physician was thirty-four-year-old Dr. Willis D. Storer, who three years earlier had delivered in Los Angeles the future film dance director Busby Berkeley. The Swansons christened their daughter Gloria May Josephine Swanson. Even as an infant, Baby Gloria was fashionably adorned. <br>Addie was quite a seamstress, and to distract attention from what she felt were Gloria&#x2019;s large ears, she fashioned huge bows for her hair and large hats for her to wear. She always saw that her daughter was dressed in clean and fancy dresses, usually with large collars. Despite Bertha&#x2019;s stern warning that Addie spoiled the child, she willfully did just that, and Joseph reluctantly allowed his wife her way. <br>&#x201c;She never dressed the way the other girls dressed,&#x201d; Gloria&#x2019;s second daughter, Michelle, would recall in an interview. &#x201c;She always had something particular. She told me that when she was a child her mother would make something special for her.&#x201d;7 Though she was a pretty young girl with an olive complexion and almond-shaped blue eyes&#x2014;perhaps her most attractive feature&#x2014;Gloria also was her worst critic. &#x201c;How I hated my teeth,&#x201d; she remarked years later. &#x201c;They were so big and square that I always kept my mouth covered with my hand when I smiled.&#x201d;8 A modest remark, and selectively true. <br>When Gloria entered grade school she was determined not to pay attention in class, much to the consternation of her second-grade teacher, Bertha L. Wernecke. She would spend her time drawing pictures of herself, her parents, and her pets.9 Addie took her child&#x2019;s doodlings as God-given talent, and, according to Gloria, enrolled her in classes at the Chicago Art Institute at an early age. <br>While attending the Art Institute, she wrote, she once peeked into an art class where a half-clad male model was posing. Sex, which was never discussed in front of her, held a deep and insatiable fascination. She expounded on this some years later. &#x201c;I hated being a child,&#x201d; she told a movie magazine writer. &#x201c;I wanted terribly to be grown-up. I was never interested in things of childhood. I felt always that I was simply marking time through an intolerably dull and monotonous prelude to something real, something mysterious and poignant&nbsp;&#x2026; No doubt sex and marriage and the having of children were the hidden, half-guessed at things that so intrigued me.&#x201d;10 <br>There exist pictures of little Gloria playing with her dolls. However, as Gloria Swanson, movie star, she would distance herself from her childhood normalcy. &#x201c;I never played with dolls,&#x201d; she claimed. &#x201c;I had as a child no maternal complex. I seldom played with other children. I preferred my own company or the company of adults from whom I might, at some unexpected moment, catch a glimpse of the mystery I continually felt them to know.&#x201d;11 <br>In 1907 Joseph was transferred to the Key West Barracks in Florida. Addie and Gloria remained in Chicago until the late spring. The importance of her father in Gloria&#x2019;s early life and his influence on her emotional development cannot be overestimated. Her feelings for men as an adult would be governed by her longings for security and guidance from the man she most desired in her life. &#x201c;My father was the greatest single influence in my life during the years when my mind was plastic, when it was in the formative state,&#x201d; she related in the 1920s. &#x201c;But for him I might have been a stenographer or a clerk in a department store&nbsp;&#x2026; It was his philosophy in my up-bringing more than anything else which gave me the wisdom, the ability and the strength to take advantage of the opportunities which, later in life, came my way.&#x201d;12 Her own elder daughter confirmed Joseph&#x2019;s impact on his only child. &#x201c;She had a keen mind and curious mind,&#x201d; Gloria Daly stated. &#x201c;She always said her father instilled that in her&#x2014;to search out the answers for a lot of things.&#x201d;13 <br>Addie and Gloria joined Joseph in the spring of 1908. He met them at the Tampa Bay Hotel in Tampa, and the family spent the day sightseeing. At the Key West Army Base, they soon settled into their new house, which stood on stilts and had a large veranda. <br>Gloria loved Florida because of the sunshine and the feel of the tropics. She also discovered she liked to sing. Attending a Protestant church, she was asked by her Sunday school teacher to warble a solo at a service. Imitating Addie&#x2019;s singing voice, eight-year-old Gloria somehow got through &#x201c;The Rosary.&#x201d; With that and the encouragement of a local actress named Venice Hayes, she sang again in a show staged at the Odd Fellows Hall, on Caroline Street. She chose &#x201c;As the World Rolls On,&#x201d; sans accompaniment, as no one was available to play the piano. Amateur night in the Keys for sure, but she felt like a star, soaking up the attention. <br>On October 11, 1909, a major hurricane hit the Keys. The women and children on the base had been evacuated, Addie and Gloria departing by boat to New York. They then traveled by train to Chicago, where their hurricane survival story made Gloria popular among the other children. At the beginning of the summer Addie and Gloria rejoined Joseph in Key West. <br>In 1910 Joseph was restationed, and the family moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico. They would live there until 1913, with Addie and Gloria taking a boat to and from Florida and a train back and forth from New York or Florida to Chicago for visits. Gloria&#x2019;s education would suffer. <br>&#x201c;I was in 16 different grammar schools,&#x201d; Gloria recalled. &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;d be whisked away, because my father was in the Army and I was an Army brat. I&#x2019;d spend six months of the year in Chicago with my mother and grandmother, and six months in tropical countries with my father. I was always being put forward a grade, put backward a grade&#x2014;on a treadmill. I don&#x2019;t think I learned <i>one</i> solid substantial thing in school.&#x201d;14 <br>During their times together Joseph spoke intelligently to his only child, not imitating childish &#x201c;baby talk&#x201d; as did Addie. In Puerto Rico of a warm and heavily scented evening, when the heavenly Southern Cross was on display, the balmy trade winds wafting the air, Joseph would tell Gloria the names of stars and explain the conundrum of infinity. Gloria longed to explore the unknown, and these moments with her father she never forgot. <br>Gloria wore her hair long in pigtails or full down her back, sometimes with bangs, always with a large hat or with a bow atop her head. Pictures taken on board ship and in San Juan with other army children show her leading a pet goat and holding a blond doll. Gloria felt very special indeed. &#x201c;I was an Army brat,&#x201d; she once remarked. &#x201c;I hung around adults a lot but was shy with children my own age.&#x201d;15 <br>Gloria&#x2019;s first acting role was in a public school production of <i>The American Girl,</i> in which she also sang a song backed by a chorus of other girls. A young beau sent her flowers, and her father posted a star on her dressing room door with her name on it&#x2014;&#x201c;Gloria Swanson,&#x201d; not Glory as everyone called her&#x2014;which bolstered her importance. Thirteen-year-old Gloria knew she was good, and decided then and there on the stage of the San Juan Opera House to become an opera diva. <br>Gloria had been enrolled in private school in San Juan but convinced her parents to allow her to attend public school so she could perform in plays. She was also possibly motivated by the opportunity to be around boys. She had recently received a letter from young, blond Carlton Swiggett from New York, whom she had met while he was vacationing in Puerto Rico. She was determined to be his girlfriend. <br>As she approached puberty Gloria was very aware of her burgeoning sexuality. &#x201c;Looking back on my life,&#x201d; she related in an unedited recording in 1955, &#x201c;what I tried to do was to find satisfaction for my physical as well as the mental&nbsp;&#x2026; And this was a very difficult thing to do&nbsp;&#x2026; and my father was probably the person that I was in love with&nbsp;&#x2026; I can remember when I was quite young, maybe thirteen or fourteen years old, the awakening pertaining to&#x2014;sex. I can remember he smelled good to me and I already associate&#x2014;because I have the nose of a rabbit&#x2014;I always associate this sense of smell with people that I like&nbsp;&#x2026; Also I looked up to him because there was nothing that I wanted to know that he didn&#x2019;t seem to be able to answer.&#x201d;16 <br>Through her father Gloria met Medora Grimes, a year older than she, from Staten Island, New York, whose wealthy family Joseph had shown around Puerto Rico. Before Medora sailed back to New York, Gloria promised to visit her. Her self-assurance knew no boundaries. &#x201c;I was enormously self-confident,&#x201d; she later told a journalist. &#x201c;I always expected to be invited to everything and to be the center of things when I was invited. If a play was given, in school, at a club, in any gathering I was confident that I would be asked to be the star performer. I was the invincible and central factor of the universe, I thought.&#x201d;17 <br>In 1913 Joseph was stationed at Governors Island off Manhattan, and Gloria and her mother moved back to Chicago to live with Grandma Lew. Gloria was reluctantly enrolled into eighth grade at Chicago&#x2019;s Lincoln School. Though she was never very good at disciplined study, on June 26, 1914, she graduated, effectively ending her formal education. She was fifteen years old. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Stephen Michael Shearer <br></p><h2>The Ghosts&#39; Trip to Loch Ness</h2><p>Four ghosts travel to Loch Ness in Scotland to see if they can spot the Loch Ness monster</p><p>JACQUES DUQUENNOY has created several comics, puzzles, and games for children.

As this meticulously researched book tracks his film career in fascinating detail, it tells the parallel tale of his complicated relationships with Marlene Dietrich and Patricia Neal (to name only two of many), his involvement with the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Hollywood black-list, and his long friendship with Ernest Hemingway.</p><p>With the full cooperation of the actor's daughter as well as such colleagues and close friends as Arlene Dahl and Fay Wray, Meyers examines every aspect of Cooper's life, beginning with his youth in Montana where he was a real cowboy before making the leap to Hollywood. There he created some of the quintessential screen westerns in movie history -- awkward, honest men who captured America's imagination with an irresistible air of aw-shucks simplicity. <em>Gary Cooper</em> is a robust portrait of a great star whose contradictions only enhance the artistry with which he created some of the most unforgettable and enduring characters of Hollywood's Golden Age.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Jeffrey Meyers, a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, has written fifty-two books, including <em>Samuel Johnson: The Struggle</em>, <em>The Genius and the Goddess: Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe</em>, <em>Orwell: Life and Art</em>, <em>John Huston: Courage and Art</em>, <em>Remembering Iris Murdoch</em>, and <em>Thomas Mann's Artist-Heroes</em>. His books have been translated into fourteen languages and seven alphabets, and published on six continents.</p>The indefatigably prolific Meyers (Bogart: A Life in Hollywood, 1997, etc.) continues to work his way through the major icons of American film. Gary Cooper didn't set out to be an actor. Given a choice, he would have preferred to be a painter in the mold of the great western artist Charles Russell. But he was born into the roles in which he became best known, a lanky, laconic westerner, son of English parents living in Montana, raised on a ranch but educated (albeit briefly) in England. He fell into film acting more or less by accident, taking extra and stunt work while living with his family in Hollywood in the mid-1920s, replacing a missing actor on a silent western and revealing an affinity for the camera. His rise was stunningly fast, so much so that in 1931 he suffered a nervous breakdown. When he returned after a few months rest, he became bigger than ever. What is forgotten about Cooper is that his best work was not in westerns (or his equally famous pair of Frank Capra films, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and Meet John Doe) but, rather, in the more rarified world of romantic comedy, particularly in an unlikely but highly successful series of collaborations with the urbane Ernst Lubitsch (Design for Living, Desire), Howard Hawks (Ball of Fire) and Billy Wilder (Love in the Afternoon), and romantic dramas like A Farewell to Arms. Meyers seems more interested in recounting Coop's numerous sexual conquests--his tempestuous affair with Lupe Velez, his several marriages and various dalliances--than in the films, and his critical judgment is unexceptional. Frankly, he has little of interest to say about the films, and when he attempts to generalize (as in a lengthy peroration on the role of the 1929 version of The Virginian in shaping the film western), his statements are riddled with clichs and inaccuracies. The books lifeless prose suggests great haste and no small lack of interest. (16 pages b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The animals, plants, and people that inhabited the lands beyond Europe were unknown, at least as far as the Western world was concerned. The rivers and jungles of the Amazon, the Badlands of Pata - gonia and of the American West, the tropical forests of Indonesia, the savannah and center of Africa, the vast interior of Central Asia, the polar regions, and the many chains of islands that dot the oceans were complete mysteries.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, while our knowledge of the world&#x2019;s living inhabitants was slim, our grasp of our planet&#x2019;s past was nonexistent. Fossils had been known for millennia, but they were seen in the light of local mythologies about dragons and other imagined creatures, not in the light of natural science.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our sense of the time scale of life on earth? Vague and vastly off the mark.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And our picture of our own species&#x2019; history? A set of fantastic myths and fairy tales.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The explorations of the previously unseen parts of the world and the unearthing of the history of life and our origins are some of the greatest achievements in human history. This book tells the stories of some of the most dramatic adventures and important discoveries in two centuries of natural history&#x2014; from the epic journeys of pioneering naturalists to the expeditions making headlines today &#x2014; and how they inspired and have expanded one of the greatest ideas of modern science: evolution.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will encounter many amazing creatures of the past and present, but the most remarkable creatures in these stories are the men and women. They are, without exception, remarkable people who have experienced and accomplished extraordinary things. They have lived the kinds of lives that Twain extolled&#x2014; they walked where no others had walked, saw what no one else had seen, and thought what no one else had thought.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people in these stories followed their dreams&#x2014; to travel to faraway lands, to see wild and exotic places, to collect beautiful, rare, or strange animals, or to find the remains of extinct beasts or human ancestors. Very few started out with any notion of great achievement or fame. Several lacked formal education or training. Rather, they were driven by a passion to explore nature, and they were willing, sometimes eager, to take great risks to pursue their dreams. Many faced the perils of traveling long distances by sea. Some confronted the extreme climates of deserts, jungles, or the Arctic. Many left behind skeptical and anxious loved ones, and a few endured years of unimaginable loneliness.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their triumphs were much more than survival and the collecting of specimens from around the world. A few pioneers, provoked by a riot of diversity beyond their wildest imaginations, were transformed from collectors into scientists. They posed and pondered the most fundamental questions about Nature. Their answers sparked a revolution that changed, profoundly and forever, our perception of the living world and our place within it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike their privileged countrymen back in the universities, churches, and drawing rooms of Europe, most of whom believed that the origins of living things was a matter outside the realm of natural science, these explorers asked not just what existed, but wondered how and why these creatures came to be. Unlike their teachers, who pursued a natural theology that interpreted everything in Nature as part of the design of a Creator &#x2014; peaceful, harmonious, stable, and unchanging &#x2014; this new cadre of naturalists discovered that Nature was, in fact, a dynamic and perpetual battleground in which creatures competed and struggled to survive, a war in which they either adapted and changed or were exterminated. Unlike their predecessors, who explained the distribution of living species in the world much as one would the instant and premeditated placement of pieces on a chessboard, these naturalists discovered that the world and the life it contained had a very long history that shaped where various plants and animals were found across the globe. And, unlike their contemporaries who viewed everything in Nature as being purposely created for man&#x2019;s benefit and domination, they rejected that conceit and placed humans within the animal kingdom, with our own earthly origins.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The torch of this revolution has been passing from generation to generation of scientists who have been walking, literally and figuratively, in the footsteps of these pioneers.<br> <i><br> A mixture of spirit and deed<br> </i>My goals in writing this book are to bring to life the pursuit and the pleasure of scientific discovery, at the same time capturing the significance of each advance for evolutionary science. The idea here is that science is far better understood and enjoyed, and made memorable, when we follow the bumpy roads of the scientists that led, eventually, to their achievements. It is not an original idea. Like the naturalists described here who trod in their predecessors&#x2019; footsteps, I am following the lead of authors such as Paul de Kruif (Microbe Hunters) and C. W. Ceram (Gods, Graves, and Scholars), whose works brought the passion and excitement of the glory days of microbiology and archaeology, respectively, to many readers. The stories I tell were chosen for both their dramatic content and scientific importance. I have, I confess, "cherry-picked" the rich lore of natural history for the best of the best.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ceram described adventure as "a mixture of spirit and deed." These stories are intended to capture those two elements in a compact form. They are crafted for enjoyment, not as scholarly biographies or histories of science. I have not delved into the biographical depth that would be necessary in full-length treatments. I have provided some background where I thought it would offer insights into who or what kindled the spirit of adventure in these naturalists and scientists.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever possible I relied on field notes, journals, expedition reports, and other firsthand accounts because they tend to contain the person&#x2019;s thoughts and reactions at critical moments. I also examined original scientific papers because they are the material of record of what exactly was found, concluded, and proposed. Many of the individuals or discoveries described here have also been the subject of one, several, or many excellent books, some written in the first person and others by biographers. You will find the many sources I relied on in "Sources and Further Reading," at the back of the book, and I certainly encourage you to explore them. I had a blast researching these stories.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book is not a compendium of the greatest evolutionary scientists or discoveries (although many here would certainly be on any such list), nor is it a history of the field. But the individuals here do represent very well the spirit of the enterprise, and many scientists, myself included, have drawn inspiration from one or more of them. So if you sense a lack of objectivity and a hagiographic bent, I am guilty as charged. There is much to admire in the protagonists of these stories. I have not paid attention to whether someone was a good citizen, good with money, or even a good spouse (some were, some weren&#x2019;t). These people had (or have) very rewarding and satisfying lives because of the great pleasure they gained from what they have done. I did not want to write a book about miserable bastards (although, come to think of it, that might be fun and would make for a catchy title).<br> <i><br> The search for origins<br> </i>The scientific quest driving all of these stories is the search for the origins of species, what was referred to by early scientists and philosophers as "the mystery of mysteries," "the question of questions," or the "supreme problem of biology." I will begin my tales and set the stage for the main body of the book with a short account of one of the boldest and most important scientific voyages ever undertaken. I am not referring to Darwin&#x2019;s famous journey but to the expedition through South and Central America made three decades earlier by Alexander von Humboldt (Chapter 1). It has been said that all scientists are descendants of Humboldt, who in the course of his travels made contributions to virtually every branch of science. We will see, however, that the magnificent flora, fauna, and fossils were perceived very differently by this great explorer than by those who followed him. Though brilliant, Humboldt and his illustrious circle of friends belonged to an age that embraced a religious vision of nature. Humboldt thus offers a view of the world before the revolution, and though he did not perceive a solution to the mystery of mysteries or even that the problem of origins could be solved, his journey blazed the trail for and directly inspired the wave of naturalists who did.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main body of the book is organized into three parts, each of which focuses on one major aspect of the search for origins &#x2014; of species in general (Part I), of particular kinds of animals (Part II), and of humans (Part III). Each part is preceded by a brief preamble that provides some background for the stories within it, and I have ordered the chapters in such a way that the connections between the scientists, discoveries, and ideas are highlighted in successive chapters. In Part I ("The Making of a Theory"), we follow the epic voyages of Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace, who solved the origins problem, and of Henry Walter Bates, who discovered superb evidence of the process of natural selection. In Part II ("The Loveliest Bones"), we retrace several of the greatest expeditions and most spectacular finds in paleontology, which have thrown light on the origins of the animal kingdom and various major groups within it. And, in Part III ("The Natural History of Humans"), we track some discoveries from the archaeological and fossil records and explore new insights from the DNA record that have shaped our understanding of human origins.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book debuts, not coincidentally, on the anniversaries of several milestones in natural history and evolutionary science. In 2009, we mark Charles Darwin&#x2019;s 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his On the Origin of Species. It is certainly fitting to celebrate the ideas and achievements of our greatest naturalist and the leader of this scientific revolution, and this book is in part my contribution to that party. We also mark the 100th anniversary of Charles Walcott&#x2019;s discovery of the remarkable animals of the Burgess Shale, which documented the Cambrian Explosion (Chapter 6), as well as the 50th anniversary of Mary and Louis Leakey&#x2019;s first ancient hominid find, which redirected the study of human origins back to Africa (Chapter 11).<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But my aim goes well beyond these famous events. There is, for example, another, less well known anniversary to recognize, and its being so less well known is a matter of some concern that I hope to redress in my own small way. One hundred and fifty years ago, on July 1, 1858, the fruit of Darwin&#x2019;s and Wallace&#x2019;s great adventures&#x2014; the theory of natural selection&#x2014; was first presented publicly before a small audience of the Linnean Society in London and subsequently published in the society&#x2019;s journal. For reasons not altogether clear, nor for which there would be a scholarly consensus, this event and Wallace&#x2019;s contributions to it tend to be overlooked. Indeed, the most widely used college biology textbooks typically offer many pages about Darwin&#x2019;s travels and work and just a few vague lines about Wallace: "a young British naturalist working in the East Indies who had developed a theory of natural selection similar to Darwin&#x2019;s." Wallace, I think, is in danger of disappearing from textbooks altogether. And that, I hope you will agree after reading Chapter 3, would be a shame.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not a shame just because of the issue of credit in history. It is a shame because we are deprived of a great story of spirit and deed &#x2014; Wallace&#x2019;s two long journeys, with a shipwreck in between, and his dozen years in the forests of the Amazon and Indonesia, and how and why he came to similar ideas as Darwin did while toiling on the other side of the globe. It is an inspiring tale of great passion, dedication, physical risk and endurance, perseverance, and the immense pleasure of discovery. There is so much to learn from his struggles and triumphs and to admire in his character.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same can be said of all the naturalists and scientists in this book. In fact, one of the most important experiences shared by virtually every person in these stories is that their discoveries and ideas were initially rejected or doubted. One might have thought that finding the first ape-man or a new dinosaur, or deciphering some critical piece of history in DNA, would confer instant glory. Think again. Many struggled for decades before gaining widespread acceptance and recognition. Such is the nature of breakthroughs and revolutions in science.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What also unites the naturalists here unites all of us as humans&#x2014; the urge to explore. New discoveries about the origins of our species reveal that most of us are the descendants of explorers, humans who migrated out of Africa just 60,000 years ago or so and eventually populated six continents (Chapter 13). Even if it may now be only from the safety of our armchairs or theater seats, we share a deep need to know the world around us.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In July 1976, on the eve of the historic landing of the Viking I spacecraft on Mars, NASA assembled a panel of luminaries, including the authors Roy Bradbury and James Michener, the physicist Philip Morrison, and the undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau, to discuss the motives for exploration. Most saw it as a matter of human instinct.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cousteau offered, "What is the origin of the devouring curiosity that drives men to commit their lives, their health, their reputation, their fortunes, to conquer a bit of knowledge, to stretch our physical, emotional or intellectual territory? The more I spend time observing nature, the more I believe that man&#x2019;s motivation for exploration is but the sophistication of a universal instinctive drive deeply ingrained in all living creatures." Morrison agreed that "it is in our nature" and that "human beings explore because in the long run . . . both by genetics and by culture, we can do nothing else."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the last thing I would want to imply through these stories is that the best days of scientific exploration are behind us. Far from it. Several of the stories here unfolded in just the last few years.

Straus, MD</b>, author of the acclaimed <i>Rosalyn Yalow, Nobel Laureate</i>, is emeritus professor of medicine at the State University of New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn. He was formerly chief of the Division of Digestive Diseases, director of the Digestive Disease Training Program, and acting cochair of the Department of Medicine there. He is the author of approximately 150 articles in the medical and scientific literature.<br><br><b>Alex Straus</b> is a contributing editor at <i>Maxim</i> magazine, specializing in new technology, sports, and feature-length articles. He is the author of <i>Guerilla Golf</i>.Preface<br><br>"I swear by Apollo the physician ..." &#x2014;The Hippocratic Oath<br><br>"For of the most High cometh healing." &#x2014;Ecclesiasticus 38:2<br><br>This book took shape in response to a question I was asked while giving a Grand Rounds presentation at a medical school. I was lecturing about an uncommon hormonal disorder when a senior medical student rose to say that she had a patient who might have this disease. &#x201c;I have read your papers, professor, it is all very interesting, but my patient cannot afford the diagnostic tests or treatments. And with the weaponization of disease, and the commerce in human organs, and the racism and sexism right here in this school, which I assure you is better than most, and . . . Dr. Straus, tell me why I should not quit medicine. What is so great about medicine?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Think of all the good you can do,&#x201d; I said, aware of how unhelpful that answer was, and excusing my tragicomic irrelevance by recognizing that, after all, I only had a few seconds to come up with an answer to this deeply perplexing question. The question stuck with me like a forlorn song. It presented itself differently in a variety of situations, until I began formulating better answers in my mind. And then I began to believe that the issues that kept arising were especially relevant now, in these healthcare-challenged times. So, after forty years of practicing medicine, of teaching as a professor of medicine and serving as department chair in four medical schools, of doing research at the &#x201c;cutting edge&#x201d; in elite settings, and traveling the world learning, teaching, and consulting with the health ministries of countries like China and India, I decided to buckle down and put my thoughts down on computer. At first it was in the spirit of Gustave Flaubert, &#x201c; . . . simply for the pleasure of writing, for myself alone. . . . Apollo at least will be grateful to me. . . .&#x201d; But then, as the project grew, I enlisted the collaboration of my son for the intelligent layman&#x2019;s point of view, and it didn&#x2019;t hurt that he is an accomplished journalist.&nbsp;<br><br>Among &#x201c;the better angels of our nature,&#x201d; those concerned with the relief of suffering, healing, and prevention of illness, deserve a special place in our hearts. At this time, when scientific and technological advances frequently are seen as having destructive potential, and the very notion of progress may be questioned, we examine human ingenuity&#x2019;s most hallowed ground. Advances in the art and science of healing are among the great achievements of human culture, and to describe the greatest among them is an awesome challenge.<br><br>This book is an introduction to some of the great ideas, people, and accomplishments that have influenced the development of healing. It is a celebration of human intellect, spirit, and soul. It is not a history per se of medicine&#x2014;it is equally concerned with our current climate, and we hope it is a call to thought and action. If you want to understand where medicine is going, if you want a powerful and accurate lens through which to view society, then we hope this book is for you. Our thesis is that we all must play a role to ensure that medicine is applied for the benefit of life. From the reaction I&#x2019;ve received from both the medical and the lay community alike to lectures and articles, I can see that there is intense interest in these stories of discovery and the issues they raise. Healthcare is among the most significant issues of our time, and it will be more so in the future. Sad but true, healthcare is now a battleground, and it is hazardous to have opinions and take action without background knowledge. More dangerous still is to sit on the sidelines as the destiny of your people is fought over and squandered.<br><br>Here we will celebrate the greatest advances in medicine. Our fundamental criterion for inclusion among the greatest developments is that the idea, treatment, device, institution, or tradition has had a major effect upon the lives of people. For the most part, we use &#x201c;great&#x201d; to mean eminent or excellent, thus connoting a positive value. Almost all these great advances have resulted in unprecedented improvements in health or alleviation of suffering. In some circumstances, however, great is used to imply intensity, or extent of hope and excitement behind a development that, while causing sweeping change, may be of questionable value. In this context, the advance represents the way medicine moved into the future, but not necessarily improved. Of course, with the passage of time the relative impact of certain advances can change. For example, the human genome project, so full of potential, has yet to make its ultimate mark in terms of its benefit. For this reason there will, and should, be legitmate debate regarding this list. Therefore it is important to undersand the standards by which we made our selections. Each advance had to satisfy one or more of the following four criteria:<br><br>1. It changed the course of medicine.<br>2. It resulted in profound relief of suffering.<br>3. It caused a fundamental improvement in the understanding of health and disease.<br>4. It produced great improvement in prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of disease.<br><br>Medicine is a uniquely human activity, so it should not surprise us that many of the greatest advances are human developments, rather than technological innovations. And because of medicine&#x2019;s human element, it is full of paradoxes and hard choices, as well as meaningful contributions from non-physician-scientists. In fact, the scientific community understands that it always needs the thoughts and opinions of people like you. We hope that you find our listing and discussions to be interesting, informative, controversial, occasionally infuriating, and subject to improvement. Choosing the 100 greatest advances was difficult. Ranking them in order of importance, as we do here, was impossible, perhaps even foolhardy, but we attempted it only for the purposes of contemplation and discussion, beginning with the most significant advancement through the next 100 in importance.&nbsp;<br><br>Enjoy, discuss, and get involved!&nbsp;<br><br>Eugene Straus, MD<br>West Shokan, NY<br>March 2005</p><h2>Manic: A Memoir</h2><p><blockquote><p>"I didn't tell anyone that I was going to Santa Fe to kill myself."</p></blockquote><p>On the outside, Terri Cheney was a highly successful, attractive Beverly Hills entertainment lawyer. But behind her seemingly flawless fa�ade lay a dangerous secret&#x2014;for the better part of her life Cheney had been battling debilitating bipolar disorder and concealing a pharmacy's worth of prescriptions meant to stabilize her moods and make her "normal."</p><p>In bursts of prose that mirror the devastating highs and extreme lows of her illness, Cheney describes her roller-coaster life with shocking honesty&#x2014;from glamorous parties to a night in jail; from flying fourteen kites off the edge of a cliff in a thunderstorm to crying beneath her office desk; from electroshock therapy to a suicide attempt fueled by tequila and prescription painkillers.</p><p>With <em>Manic</em>, Cheney gives voice to the unarticulated madness she endured. The clinical terms used to describe her illness were so inadequate that she chose to focus instead on her own experience, in her words, "on what bipolar disorder felt like inside my own body." Here the events unfold episodically, from mood to mood, the way she lived and remembers life. In this way the reader is able to viscerally experience the incredible speeding highs of mania and the crushing blows of depression, just as Cheney did. Manic does not simply explain bipolar disorder&#x2014;it takes us in its grasp and does not let go.</p><p>In the tradition of <em>Darkness Visible</em> and <em>An Unquiet Mind</em>, <em>Manic</em> is <em>Girl, Interrupted</em> with the girl all grown up. This harrowing yet hopeful book is more than just a searing insider's account of what it's really like to live with bipolar disorder. It is a testament to the sharp beauty of a life lived in extremes.</p></p><p><p>Having specialized in intellectual property and entertainment law at several prominent Los Angeles firms, Terri Cheney now devotes her talents to the cause of mental illness.

Fragrant Darjeelings, malty Assams, and her current favorite, a house-blended orchid plum tea that tickled her fancy as well as her taste buds.</p><p>On the other hand, how often did a girl get invited to a fancy wine-tasting party at the very upscale Knighthall Winery?</p><p>Rarely. In fact, tonight was a first for Theodosia. And her invitation to this lushly groomed vineyard, located a leisurely drive from Charleston, South Carolina, came at the behest of Drayton Conneley, her right-hand man and tea expert at the Indigo Tea Shop. Luckily for Theodosia, Drayton happened to be a dear friend of Jordan Knight, Knighthall Winery&#x2019;s slightly flamboyant proprietor.</p><p>&#x201c;You see?&#x201d; said Drayton, grabbing her elbow and steering her toward an enormous trestle table set under a spreading live oak. He was sixty-something and still debonair with a prominent nose and thatch of gray hair. &#x201c;Jordan managed to produce four completely different varieties of wine.&#x201d; Wine bottles beckoned like shiny beacons, and attentive waiters were more than willing to fill glasses. &#x201c;Amazing, wouldn&#x2019;t you say?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Amazing,&#x201d; Theodosia echoed. She didn&#x2019;t know if four varieties was a feat worth celebrating, but Drayton certainly seemed impressed. And the grounds of the winery did look absolutely magical this September evening, all lit up and sparkling like a scene from some elegant Austrian fairy tale. Plantation oaks and pecan trees were iced in silvery lights, candles floated in a free-form pool, a string quartet played lively music, and a handsome magician in white tie and tails amused guests with fluttering, disappearing pigeons and sly card tricks.</p><p>Drayton handed Theodosia a crystal flute filled with white wine. &#x201c;This is Knighthall&#x2019;s White Shadow,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;Although I&#x2019;d call it more of a Riesling.&#x201d;</p><p>Theodosia took a small sip and found the wine to be utterly delicious. Crisp and aromatic, with hints of apples and citrus. Not unlike a fine oolong tea. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s spectacular,&#x201d; she replied.</p><p>&#x201c;I told you,&#x201d; said Drayton. &#x201c;Lots of folks thought it would be next to impossible to grow grapes out here on Wadmalow Island, but Jordan&#x2019;s definitely proved them wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>If tea plants could grow here and flourish, Theodosia thought to herself, why not grape vines? Although perhaps a sandier soil was needed? Wasn&#x2019;t a sandier, rockier soil supposed to prove the true mettle of the grape?</p><p>They stepped away from the tasting table and looked around, enjoying the warmth and excitement of the evening and the rather excellent people watching.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d say the cr�me de la cr�me of Charleston is here in full force tonight,&#x201d; said Theodosia. Tanned and toned women in chiffon dresses drifted by, wafting perfumed scents that hinted at lilies and lilacs. Men in seersucker suits also wandered the elegant grounds, sipping wine as well as an occasional tumbler of bourbon. Of course, Charleston folk being the congenial sort, everyone seemed quite preoccupied with the exchange of air kisses and pleasantries, pretending not to notice if they themselves were being noticed.</p><p>&#x201c;The beautiful people,&#x201d; Drayton mused. &#x201c;Dressed to the nines just in case a society photographer should happen along.&#x201d; Of course, he was also dazzling in a blue-and-white seersucker suit&#x2014;a sartorial Southern statement that was punctuated by his trademark red bow tie.</p><p>Theodosia would have denied it, of course, practically laughed in your face, but she was also one of the beautiful people. With an abundance of auburn hair that might have inspired a painter like Raphael, creamy English skin, and sparkling blue eyes, she looked like she might have slipped in from another, earlier, century. She was bold yet tactful, filled with dreams and yet practical for her thirty-some years. Her only flaws were that she tended to wear her heart on her sleeve and often rushed in where proverbial angels feared to tread.</p><p>&#x201c;Jordan!&#x201d; Drayton called out as Jordan Knight, the owner of Knighthall Winery, came up to greet them. &#x201c;Congratulations on such a fine turnout.&#x201d; He turned to include Theodosia. &#x201c;And this is Theodosia Browning, I don&#x2019;t believe you two have met.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks for coming,&#x201d; said Knight as he shook hands with each of them. He was midforties, with a shock of salt-and-pepper hair, watery blue eyes, and a slightly pink complexion. He&#x2019;d removed his jacket, loosened his tie, and his manner seemed to veer between nervous and ebullient.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure I just convinced the owner of the Lady Goodwood Inn to carry my wine,&#x201d; Knight chortled. In his other, more practical life, he was the CEO of Whizzen Software. Knighthall Winery was his most recently established passion.</p><p>&#x201c;Well done,&#x201d; said Drayton, clapping his friend on the back. </p><p>&#x201c;Your winery appears to be thriving,&#x201d; Theodosia told Knight. Being a business owner herself, she knew how difficult it was for a company to succeed, let alone flourish, in today&#x2019;s tough business climate. And the deck was stacked against upstarts even more.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re starting to gain some traction,&#x201d; Knight responded. &#x201c;We have distribution to thirty liquor stores in something like five states. And my son is in the process of helping to negotiate a potentially large deal with a Japanese distributor, as well.&#x201d; Knight gazed about distractedly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve met my son, Drew, haven&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Drayton nodded yes. Theodosia shook her head no.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to say hello to him,&#x201d; said Drayton. &#x201c;Is he here tonight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Drew&#x2019;s around here somewhere,&#x201d; said Knight as he cast a quick glance at the large crowd and shrugged. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s no doubt managing all the behind-the-scenes activity.&#x201d; Now he glanced nervously at his watch.</p><p>&#x201c;Relax,&#x201d; Drayton told him. &#x201c;This is your big night. Enjoy it!&#x201d;</p><p>Knight grimaced. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a little antsy about my presentation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is that?&#x201d; Theodosia inquired politely.</p><p>&#x201c;In about five minutes,&#x201d; said Knight, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re going to do a special barrel tasting of our new cabernet reserve.&#x201d; He flashed a perfunctory smile. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re calling it Knight Music.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Catchy,&#x201d; said Theodosia.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re pinning all our hopes on this one,&#x201d; said Knight. &#x201c;Going for broke.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m guessing that several of Charleston&#x2019;s food and wine critics are in attendance tonight?&#x201d; said Drayton.</p><p>Knight nodded. &#x201c;We invited anybody and everybody who can give us a mention, article, or shout-out. After five years of moving heaven and earth to produce four varieties of muscadine grapes, it&#x2019;s all come down to this one make-or-break moment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good luck to you then,&#x201d; said Theodosia as Knight hurried away.</p><p>Theodosia and Drayton edged their way slowly through the crowd, in the direction Jordan had gone. A makeshift stage had been set up just outside a large, hip-roofed barn, and two workers were rolling out an enormous oak barrel. Two Japanese men, both wearing white suits and standing ramrod-stiff, stood nearby, watching intently.</p><p>Theodosia gave Drayton a nudge. &#x201c;Those must be the Japanese distributors your friend Jordan mentioned.&#x201d;</p><p>Drayton nodded. &#x201c;I read a recent article in the Financial Times about how the Japanese are suddenly head-over-heels crazy for wine. Particularly the pricier ones.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sake being so last year,&#x201d; said Theodosia.</p><p>&#x201c;Everything is cyclical,&#x201d; said Drayton, trying to sound practical.</p><p>&#x201c;Except for tea,&#x201d; said Theodosia. &#x201c;Tea just seems to keep gaining in popularity.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And aren&#x2019;t we glad for that,&#x201d; said Drayton.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me . . . Theodosia?&#x201d; said a voice at their elbow.</p><p>Theodosia turned with a smile and her eyes met those of a good-looking man with piercing green eyes and a mop of curly blond hair. Kind of surfer dude meets buttoned-down lawyer. He was smiling back at her, and with a kind of instinctive knowledge, she realized that she knew him. The man&#x2019;s name was Andrew something. Andrew . . .</p><p>&#x201c;Andrew Turner,&#x201d; said the man, filling in the blank for her, bobbing his head. &#x201c;We met at my gallery a couple of weeks ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; said Theodosia. &#x201c;Max brought me to one of your openings&#x2014;you were featuring all sorts of dynamic, contemporary oil paintings as I recall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where you undoubtedly feasted on cheap white wine and stuffed cherry tomatoes,&#x201d; said Turner. &#x201c;The hopeful gallery owner&#x2019;s stock-in-trade.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t recall the wine,&#x201d; said Theodosia, &#x201c;but I do remember a wonderful painting that you had on display. All reds and purples and golds. Subtle but also very visceral. The artist was . . . James somebody?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Richard James,&#x201d; said Turner. &#x201c;You have a very keen eye. And as luck would have it, that particular piece is still for sale if you&#x2019;re interested.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me think about it,&#x201d; said Theodosia. She hastily introduced Turner to Drayton, then they all paused as a passing waiter stopped with his tray of hors d&#x2019;oeuvres to offer them mini crab cakes and shrimp wrapped in bacon.</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you drop by again during the Paint and Palette Art Crawl,&#x201d; Turner suggested. &#x201c;You know it kicks off this Wednesday.&#x201d;</p><p>Theodosia was about to answer, when Drayton quickly shushed them. Jordan Knight was standing on the stage next to an enormous weathered oak barrel. And it looked as if he was about to begin his speech.</p><p>The crowd hushed en masse and pressed forward to hear his presentation.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you all for coming,&#x201d; said Knight. &#x201c;This is such a proud moment for me.&#x201d; He clasped a hand to his chest in a heartfelt gesture of appreciation. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve labored long and hard to cultivate grapes here in South Carolina.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a spatter of applause.</p><p>&#x201c;And our newest vintage, Knight Music, which you are all about to taste, would never have been possible without the hard work of my manager, Tom Grady, and our many dedicated workers.&#x201d; Jordan extended a hand toward a red-haired woman who stood off to the side. &#x201c;And, of course, I must thank my wonderful family. My wife, the amazing Pandora Knight, and my son, Drew Knight.&#x201d; He smiled as his eyes searched the crowd for Drew. When he didn&#x2019;t find him, he said, &#x201c;Though my son seems to be missing in action at the moment.&#x201d;</p><p>There was more laughter and guffaws from the crowd. </p><p>As Jordan continued his speech, two workers began to tap the large barrel of wine. They fumbled around on the top, trying to get a spigot going, but it didn&#x2019;t seem to be working. </p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; said Jordan, playing to the crowd now, &#x201c;our winery is not without problems&#x2014;as you can plainly see.&#x201d; One of the workers tilted the large barrel up onto one edge. The other worker, looking frustrated and brandishing a crowbar, suddenly popped off the round, wooden top. The heavy lid went airborne, spinning in the air like an errant Frisbee, and then hit the stage with a loud bang. At that very same moment, the entire barrel seemed to teeter dangerously.</p><p>&#x201c;Whoa!&#x201d; Jordan shouted. &#x201c;Careful there. We&#x2019;re going to sample that fine wine.&#x201d;</p><p>But the giant barrel, unbalanced and heavy with wine, was more than the workers could handle. They fought valiantly to right it, but were beginning to lose their grip.</p><p>Slowly, the barrel tipped sideways and viscous red liquid began to spill out, sloshing across the stage and spattering the crowd. There were sharp cries of dismay from the guests as everyone tried to jump out of the way.</p><p>Jordan Knight scrambled for the barrel in a last-ditch effort to avert total disaster. He leaned down and tried to muscle his shoulder beneath the huge barrel. Unfortunately, the laws of physics had been set into motion and he was clearly too late. The barrel continued to tip, rolling over in slow motion like a sinking ocean liner making a final, dying gasp.</p><p>The barrel landed on its side with a deafening crash, and torrents of red wine gushed out like rivers of blood.</p><p>Now horrified gasps rose up from the crowd as Jordan Knight seemed to stagger drunkenly. He crumpled to his knees, landing hard, and his entire face seemed to collapse. Then an agonized shriek rose up from his lips, blotting out the music and even the gasps from the crowd.</p><p>Curiosity bubbling within her, Theodosia pushed her way through the crowd to see what on earth was going on.</p><p>And was completely shocked to see the body of a dead man lying on the stage!</p><p>He was curled up, nose to knees, like a pickled fish. His head was tilted forward, his arms clutched close across his chest. The man&#x2019;s skin, what Theodosia could see of it, was practically purple from being submerged inside the barrel of red wine.</p><p>Who? and What? were the first thoughts that formed like a cartoon bubble deep in Theodosia&#x2019;s brain. And then her eyes flicked over to Jordan Knight, who was kneeling in the spill of wine, his pant legs completely soaked with purple as tears streamed down his face and his arms flailed madly about his head.</p><p>From the look of utter devastation on Jordan Knight&#x2019;s face, Theodosia was pretty sure he&#x2019;d found his missing son.</p></p><h2>Chaka! Through the Fire</h2><p><i>Rolling Stone</i> compared it to melted caramel, and Miles Davis compared it to his horn. <br><br>Chaka Khan's scorchingly soulful voice first dazzled most of us back in 1974 with Rufus and "Tell Me Something Good," and most recently in her Grammy Award-winning performance in <i>Standing in the Shadows of Motown</i>, singing "What's Going On?" with the Funk Brothers. Over the years, she's had twelve number-one hits and nine number-one albums. Over one hundred appearances on the Billboard charts. Nineteen Grammy nominations and eight Grammy wins. Her achievements in the music industry are legendary, and like her twenty albums, they're well-known to the public. <br><br>But the private side of Chaka, the story of what fame and fortune have cost her-- and taught her-- hasn't been told before. In <i>Chaka! Through the Fire</i>, Chaka Khan gives us the whole story of the woman behind the diva and reveals her high and low points. A happy early childhood in a loving, creative home was shattered by escalating fights between her parents. When they finally split, Chaka's father disappeared without even a goodbye, leaving Chaka bewildered, bereft, and blaming her mother. She reconnected with her dad in her teens, finding that he was as liberal and permissive a parent as her mother was strict. Chaka started experimenting with drugs and joined the Black Panthers. Soon after, she fronted for a band called Rufus. <br><br>They hit it big with "Tell Me Something Good," and Chaka's stardom was launched. But life on the road was grueling, and as the years went by, the pressures grew. Chaka turned to alcohol and drugs to numb the pain of failed relationships, the guilt of leaving her kids to be raised by Grandma, the resentment she felt about the exhausting demands of her career. It wasn't until things got very bad that she started to see the patterns. All the things she had suffered through in her childhood and swore never to do to her kids-- well, she was doing them. <br><br>That's when she began the work of turning it all around. These days, she's still a musical powerhouse, but she's making sure there's time for family, too. She's drug-free. She's started her own record label and has also started a foundation to help women and children in need. Remarkably, Chaka has remained a true wild child despite all the changes: a fiercely independent woman who never compromised her spirit.</p><p><p>"...a lot of times, I was flat-out scared. In some ways, I was still a child. The mounting celebrity, the applause, the screams of the fans, and more money than I'd ever dreamed of making-- I didn't know how to handle it. And I had no mentor.... </p><p>"All I knew to do was stay in motion, stay overwhelmed. No wonder one night in Texas, as I stood on the balcony of my hotel room, high up in the sky, I thought about just ending it-- quitting the business, quitting my life. I was feeling so down, so trapped, but something-- someone's prayer? an angel? some of Great-Gramma Bagby's 'Soul Power'?-- called me back to life." </p><p>--from <i>Chaka!

If you are a preteen or teen girl, we bet that's what your head is doing right now!</p> <p>You are probably whirling in a sea of mysterious body changes, relationship blowups and confusing information. At school and with friends, you hear chatter about periods, gossip about boyfriends and whispers about sex.</p> <p>And you are probably bursting with questions. What is all this hair in weird places? Exactly how does sex happen, and why would anyone want to do that? Do I use the nasty words I see on the bathroom wall to talk about sex? What's this stuff in my underwear? What's up with my friends? Why do we fight and then make up all the time now? How doyou tell the difference between a "boyfriend" and a friend who's a boy?</p> <p>How about love and lust? And why don't my parents get it anymore? Guess what? There's nothing wrong with having questions or wanting to know more&#x2014;especially when it comes to your body, sex and relationships. All those crazy and confusing questions . . . they're normal! And you probably are, too! (Do we hear a big sigh of relief?)</p> <p><strong>Girlhood Is a Gift!</strong></p> <p>You're a girl. And you are made in an amazing and wonderful way. Because you are a girl, some things are going to happen to you: breasts, hips, pimples, periods, crushes on guys, fights with girlfriends, parents who don't get it. You have no choice; they will happen! You are turning into a young woman, and your body and your brain are making these changes because you are developing sexually. So doesn't it make sense that this is the time in your life to learn about these things?</p> <p>Some things are guaranteed to happen. But there are other girl things you can make choices about&#x2014;how you take care of your "new" body, how you use your newfound sex appeal, when you will kiss a guy or how you talk about sex to your parents. Even though there are a lot of things happening to you that are out of your control, it's good to know that there are a lot of other things that you can control.</p> <p>Girlology is going to help you open up your girlhood like a gift. We'll rip off the wrapping paper, explore the mysteries inside, learn facts about "all things girl" and help you gain the confidence you need to decide what kind of girl you want to be.</p> <p><strong>So, What Is Girlology?</strong></p> <p>Before we dive in, let's first tell you what Girlology is not:</p> <p> � Girlology is not a sex talk like you get at school. <br> � It's not a science lesson. <br> � It's not like a lecture from your parents.</p> <p>All those things can be good, but they are not Girlology. Girlology is different.</p> <p>Girlology was written by two female doctors who also happen to be mothers of daughters; one of us is a pediatrician (a doctor for children and teenagers up to about 18 years old) and the other is an obstetrician/ gynecologist (fancy words for a doctor who specializes in delivering babies and taking care of girls' and women's body parts that are involved in making babies). Both of us take care of lots of teens who are developing sexually. That means every day we talk to girls thinking about sex . . . avoiding sex . . . having sex . . . confused about sex . . . scared to death about consequences of sex. . . . You name it, we've seen it and talked about it.</p> <p>We think girls are smart, unique, brave and strong, and we want you to have information that will let all that good stuff shine through! As doctors, we see girls every day who have the same questions you do. And we see lots of girls and even women who have gotten some really wrong answers! No, your period will not stop when you go swimming. Yes, you can get pregnant the first time you have sex. No, you are not gay if you look at a naked girl in the locker room. Girlology is about giving you the straight, true facts about your body.</p> <p>We also treat patients who have made healthy decisions about sex and relationships and others who aren't so happy with the decisions they've made. We want you to be happy with the decisions you make! Girlology is about helping you figure out what's important to you so that you can make decisions you will be pleased with for a long, long, long time.</p> <p>Girlology is about helping you figure out a lot of things that matter&#x2014; your body, your relationships and sex. It may sound scary but it's not. Girlology is about periods and body parts "down there." It will help you decide how you feel about sex and sexual things. It will help you understand guys and learn how to speak up for yourself. It will help you talk to parents and other adults and gain their trust. Girlology will also teach you how to understand your friends' and family's values and decide what is important to you.

Aiken's previous novel, Eliza's Daughter (1994), focused on an offstage figure from Sense and Sensibility who confronts the former, now unhappy, Dashwood sisters. Aiken has wisely jettisoned attempts at irony and witty pyrotechnics; still, her cast members here, borrowed from Austen, take some entertaining turns. In Austen's bleak and sketchy The Watsons, probably begun in 1804 and never finished, Elizabeth Watson confides to sister Emma, with whom she has been reunited after Emma's 14 years with kind Aunt Maria, grim thoughts on their single state: ``You know we must marry . . . it is very bad to grow old and be poor and laughed at.'' But that seems to be the fate of these young women, now in their 20s, for their father, a gentle clergyman, is quite poor. The soon-to-be family head is pompous, unsympathetic brother Robert, married to horrid Jane, ``callow'' and unhelpful. Their sisters Penelope and Margaret are generally unpleasant. Aiken picks up Austen's tale and carries it imaginatively along. Penelope marries nice, elderly Dr. Harding, and buys, renovates, and moves into a grand, if decaying mansion. But heartaches abound: Elizabeth's former suitor marries another; kind brother Sam is refused marriage to pleasant Mary Edwards, pledged to dim Lord Osborne. Emma is not attracted to curate Adam, because he's tethered to the dowager Lady Osborne. And dear Aunt Maria has vanished after having borne up under the weight of a miserable marriage for many years. Before the close, when lovers will traipse off hand in hand, there will be reversals and upheavals; a fatal accident; a destructive theft and elopement; disclosure of an old scandal; a rescue; and even a rousing horse race. As always, for those attuned to Austen, and to Aiken's imaginative, respectful variations, simply charming. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Aiken's (<i>Eliza's Daughter</i>, 1994) latest work is the completion of an unfinished work by her esteemed and beloved mentor, Jane Austen, entitled <i>The Watsons</i>. Emma and Elizabeth Watson are unmarried sisters struggling to adjust to the grim reality of their socioeconomic status. Their father, a revered parson and a man of great intelligence, does not bequeath adequate provisions for the two women in the event they do not marry. Although the two sisters are not without considerable and admirable talents, achieving their own domiciles and avoiding the cruel and demeaning fate of virtually penniless spinsters is not an easily accomplished task. As they conform to the firmly entrenched morals of their social stratum, they confront numerous domestic and financial entanglements, contending with various siblings, extended family members, and eccentric local characters. The romantic tale, enhanced by the provincial and genteel hamlet of Stanton, serves as a source of hope and inspiration. Aiken continues to nurture the voracious appetites of Austen aficionados. <i>Liz Rifken</i></p><h2>The Long Snapper: A Second Chance, a Super Bowl, a Lesson for Life</h2><p>Brian Kinchen was a thirty-eight-year-old husband, father of four, and seventh-grade Bible teacher whose professional football career had been over for three years when the New England Patriots called on December 15, 2003.

Even as a little child, I was always busy putting books together. Sometimes I would bind them with yarn to hold the pages together I've always loved drawing and painting. I was also a very curious child. My parents tell me that I was always asking lots and lots of questions.</p><p>"Later, I went to the University of Illinois, where I studied graphic design. Then I moved to New York City, where I got a job doing artwork for television shows. Eventually I was asked to do the artwork for a children's show. While doing that show, some of the children asked me if I had ever thought of doing children's books. My mind immediately recalled how much I enjoyed doing that type of thing when I was a child d. So I put an idea for a book together and right away a publisher bought it. That book was called <i>Willy and His Wheel Wagon.</i></p><p>"Since then, over seventy books that I have written and illustrated have been published. The type of books I write are nonfiction books. This is because I love researching so much. I get to ask lots of questions, just like when I was a kid. I also get to travel and meet lots of interesting people. While doing research for my book <i>Nature's Green Umbrella: Tropical Rain Forests</i>, I traveled to two islands where there are tropical rain forests, Saba and Dominica.

He attended the Peers' School and Tokyo Imperial University, and for a time worked at the Ministry of Finance. His first full length novel, Confessions of a Mask, appeared in 1949, and since then he published over a dozen novels, almost all of which were translated into English and other languages during his.lifetime. They include: Thirst for Love; Forbidden Colors; Death in Midsummer; The Sound of Waves; The Temple of the Golden Pavilion; After the Banquet; The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea; and Spring Snow. <p>Mishima's reverence for the Japanese martial arts led him to take up Kendo (a type of fencing, with wooden swords) and Karate, as well as body-building, and by 1968 he had become a Kendo master of the fifth dan. He also organized a "private army" called the Shield Society, and in November 1970 he and his group forced their way into a Self-Defense Force headquarters in Tokyo, where Mishima, after reading out a proclamation, committed ritual suicide with a young follower in the commanding officer's room. On the morning of his death, the last volume of Mishima's tetralogy, The Sea of Fertility ( The Spring Snow, Runaway Horses, The Temple of Dawn, The Decay of the Angel) was delivered to his publisher. </p><p>He is survived by his wife and two children. </p><p>The Translator: John Bester, born and educated in England, is one of the foremost translators of Japanese fiction.

I was attached to a parachute squad; the day's training was over; I had been for a bath, and was on my way back to the dormitory. <p>The late afternoon sky was dyed in shades of blue and pink, and the turf spread below was an even, glowing jade. Here and there on either side of the path along which I walked stood the ageing, robust, wooden buildings, nostalgic souvenirs of an age when this had been the cavalry school: the covered riding paddock, now a gymnasium, the stables, now a post-exchange.... I was still in my P.T. clothes: long white cotton training pants just issued that day, rubber gym shoes, a running shirt. Even the mud that already soiled the bottom of the pants contributed to my sense of wellbeing. </p><p>That morning's training in handling a parachute, the extraordinarily rarified feeling as for the first time one committed oneself to the empty air, still lingered inside me, a transparent residue, fragile as a medicinal wafer. The deep, rapid breathing caused by the circuit training and running that followed had pervaded my whole body with a pleasing lethargy. Rifles, weapons of every kind, were at hand. My shoulder was ready for slinging a gun at any time. I had run to my heart's content over the green grass, felt the sun burning my skin a golden brown; beneath the summer sunlight, I had seen, thirty-five feet below me, people's shadows sharply etched and firmly attached to their feet. I had jumped into space from the summit of the silver tower, aware as I went of how the shadow that I myself would cast among them the next instant would lie isolated like a black puddle on the earth, untied to my body. At that moment I was, beyond all doubt, freed from my shadow, from my self-awareness. </p><p>My day had been full to the brim of the body and of action. There was physical excitement, and strength, and sweat, and muscle; the green grass of summer was everywhere, a breeze stirred the dust on the path I walked along, the sun's rays slowly slanted ever more obliquely, and in my training pants and gym shoes I walked amidst them quite naturally. Here was the life I had wanted. At that time, I savored the same solitary, rough-and-ready joy of the physical training instructor walking back between the old school building and the shrubbery after losing himself in the beauty of physical tralnlng on a summer's evening. </p><p>I sensed in it an absolute rest for the spirit, a beatification of the flesh. Summer, white clouds, the empty blue of the sky following the final lesson of the day, and the touch of nostalgic sadness tinging the glitter of sunlight filtering through the trees, induced a sense of intoxication. I existed....</p></p><h2>The Handbook to Handling His Lordship (Scandalous Brides Series)</h2><p><p><b>THE HANDBOOK TO HANDLING HIS LORDSHIP</b><br><b></b>SUZANNE ENOCH</p><p>Emily Portsman has a secret, and three years ago she decided the best way to keep it would be to work at the Tantalus Club, a notorious gaming establishment for gentlemen.

Beautiful and brilliant, she lived life on her own terms, scandalizing the staid society of her times with her love affairs and unconventional ways. Born in 1913 in Budapest, to a Hungarian mother and a Sikh father, Amrita spent her early years in Hungary, India, as well as France, where she studied at the renowned Ecole des Beaux Arts. Before her untimely death in 1941, she left behind a body of work that not only establishes her as one of the foremost artists of the century but also as a most eloquent symbol of fusion between the East and the West. In this fascinating biography, art historian Yashodhara Dalmia charts the course of Amrita s turbulent life, and the development of her dazzling artistic career, as she traces the influences that shaped her, examines her relationships with her family, friends, lovers and mentors, and captures her charismatic aura. Extensively researched and brimming with reminiscences of those who knew Amrita, this is a compelling portrait of the artist who, when she died at the tragically young age of twenty-eight, was probably unaware of her own greatness and of her priceless legacy to Indian art. <br><br> Beautiful and brilliant, Amrita Sher-Gil lived life on her own terms, scandalizing the staid society of her times with her love affairs and unconventional ways.

He watched one beloved deli after another shut down, one institution after another shutter only to be reopened as some bland chain-restaurant laying claim to the very culture it just paved over. And so David set out on a journey across the United States and around the world in search of authentic delicatessen. Was it still possible to <i>Save the Deli</i>?<p></p> Join David as he investigates everything deli--its history, its diaspora, its next generation. He tells us about the food itself--how it's made, who makes it best, and where to go for particular dishes. And, ultimately, there there is for hope--David finds deli newly and lovingly made in places like Boulder, traditions maintained in Montreal, and iconic institutions like the 2nd Avenue Deli resurrected in New York. So grab a pastrami on rye and sit down for a great read--because <i>Save the Deli</i>is an energetic cultural history of Jewish food, a vibrant travelogue, and a rallying cry for a new generation of food lovers.<br> <br> <br> <p> <b>Amazon Exclusive: A Letter from David Sax</b><br> </p><p></p> Dear Amazon Reader,<p></p> I assume you're here because you either love Jewish deli like Jewish deli, or want to learn to love Jewish deli. Well, you're in luck. That's why I'm here too. In fact, that's the whole idea behind <i>Save the Deli</i>. If I can get twenty more people to eat a corned-beef sandwich, I've done my part. Mission accomplished, right?<br> Well, not exactly.<p></p> As you can see from some of the reader reviews already on Amazon, deli lovers are a fiercely opinionated bunch. They know what's the best and if anyone dares say otherwise, they're willing to hit the battlefield and inflict damage. Look into those reviews and you'll read criticisms about how I didn't go to X deli, or didn't go to Y city, and how dare I say that LA has deli that's as good, or even better than New York! Who am I to question the conventional wisdom about Jewish deli? <p></p> Blasphemy! Heresy! Heartburn!<p></p> But it's true. In <i>Save the Deli</i>, I talk not only about the great delis in New York--like Katz's, Carnegie, and 2nd Ave Deli--but also about unknown places in Detroit, Chicago, Salt Lake City, LA, Denver, Florida, and Toronto. I eat deli in London, Paris, and Krakow. The point here is to convince you that great deli knows no geographical bounds, that you can have a cabbage roll in Charlotte, North Carolina, that's better than one in Brooklyn, that great blintzes aren't tied to any one city or state. <p></p> Now before you light the pyre, let me tell you about how I came to this realization.<p></p> Three years ago, when I began working on this book, I too had fallen prey to the misguided notion that great deli was only confined to New York and Montreal. Anything outside those cities had to be a pale imitation. I, like many Jewish deli lovers, was narrow-minded,could see and imagine no further than the local delicatessen I frequented...a village simpleton who knows nothing beyond his little <i>shtetl</i> and the salamis therein.<p></p> But as I hit the road, in search of the story of delicatessen in American and around the world, I tasted revelation after revelation. It first happened in Brussels, where I encountered a fancy sandwich shop called Gilles. I dismissed it as a hokey deli until I layered their delicate smoked brisket on a warm onion roll and realized an entire new world of deli potential. Two weeks later I was in Paris, eating chopped liver with foie gras, duck sausage, and calves-foot jelly at Maison David. I'd stepped through the looking glass.<p></p> When I hit the road in America things were no different. Who knew the rye bread in Detroit was the best anywhere? Who knew a new deli in Boulder, Colorado, made its own schmaltz? Who could suspect the level of kitchen prowess I'd find in Los Angeles, where a <i>kishke</i> at Brent's blew me away? <p></p> Do you know what it's like to be blown away by <i>kishke</i>? It's akin to a religious moment; your mouth is so in love with this crackling fat-stuffed sausage that it floods your brain with endorphins. It's a watershed event. I'd love for you to experience that.<p></p> Great deli knows no geographical limits. If there's one thing I learned on this whole journey to <i>Save the Deli</i>, that's it. I hope everyone that reads this book will realize this. It doesn't mean the delis in your hometown serve up sandwiches any less delicious than before. It doesn't mean that the deli you grew up with in Brooklyn was anything less than spectacular. But I implore you to look out beyond your deli counter at the world of possibilities. Then go. And taste.

Campbell, Jr.</p><p><i></i>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Astounding Science Fiction </i>as edited by Campbell was the pre�mier magazine of the golden age of American science fiction. This special reprint edition ably demonstrates why the science fiction magazines of that era were so important to the develop�ment of modern science fiction into the popular and important literary form it is today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unquestionably a classic issue, it begins with the cover story, Black Destroyer,&#x201d; the first published work of A. E. van Vogt and also features Trends&#x201d; by Isaac Asimov, his first sale to <i>Astounding. </i>Significant as these debuts are, it is the overall strength of the issue that finally impresses. These are stories by some of the best-known writers in the field: Nat Schachner, City of the Cosmic Rays&#x201d;; Nelson S. Bond, Lightship Ho!&#x201d;; Ross Rocklynne, The Moth&#x201d;; C. L.

There is a commentary on <i>Astounding </i>by Stanley Schmidt (the current editor of <i>Analog Science Fiction / Science Fact, </i>the successor to <i>Astounding</i>)<i> </i>and memoirs of the stories and the magazine by Isaac Asimov, A.

Her mama, Copper, is often gone helping to birth babies, and Lilly has to stay home. When Aunt Alice sends a note inviting her to visit in the city, Lilly is excited to go, and Copper reluctantly agrees to let her. Later, when they hear the news that the train crashed, Copper and her husband, John, rush to find out if their daughter is injured . . . or even alive.</p><p>This isWatson continues her inspiring Copper Brown series. It is no small task to be the only nurse available for delivering babies in the small community of Troublesome Creek, but Copper Pelfrey seems up to the task. When she must quarantine an expectant mother to protect the health of the entire town, she is forced to battle an angry husband and father-to-be while she works to try and save the lives of this young mother and her unborn child. But this becomes the least of her problems when the train carrying her daughter, Lilly, derails, and Lilly is nowhere to be found among the wreckage. Copper is faced with the unspeakable horror of not knowing where her child is or even if she is still alive. This tragedy will test their faith and challenge the entire family as they are reminded of where hope is found. Packed with characters full of feminine strength, Still House Pond paints a picture of nineteenth-century rural life, while offering a hint of romance and a dash of suspense. --Elizabeth Ponder</p><h2>Aleister Crowley: The Nature of the Beast</h2><p>Poet, Magician, Mountaineer, Polemicist and Pornographer, Aleister Crowley was the most famous, or infamous, name in twentieth century occultism. The popular image of him as, in the words of Francis King, "an insatiable sexual athlete, a pimp who lived on the immoral earnings of his girl-friends, and a junkie who daily took enough heroin to kill a roomful of people", has a basis in fact; but there were other, less obnoxious and despicable aspects of this highly original character. <br><br>Crowley�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s greatest legacy is his eclectic occult system: his Magick persists, a potent synthesis of Golden Dawn magic, oriental esoteric techniques, sexual magic, and the all-encompassing Law of Thelema with its two fundamental principles, "Every man and woman is a star" and the notorious "Do What Thou Wilt Shall Be the Whole of the Law". With his usual flair and style, Colin Wilson brings this complex and enigmatic figure to life and provides an engrossing portrait of the self-styled Great Beast, the man whom the contemporary press dubbed The Wickedest Man in the World.</p><p>Colin Wilson is a renowned authority on the paranormal and is the author of over fifty books, with subjects ranging from mysticism to criminology. He has also written numerous articles and plays and contributed to several newspapers and journals. He regards himself primarily as a philosopher concerned with the meaning of human existence.</p><h2>Overconfidence and War: The Havoc and Glory of Positive Illusions</h2><p><p> Opponents rarely go to war without thinking they can win--and clearly, one side must be wrong. This conundrum lies at the heart of the so-called "war puzzle": rational states should agree on their differences in power and thus not fight. But as Dominic Johnson argues in <i>Overconfidence and War</i>, states are no more rational than people, who are susceptible to exaggerated ideas of their own virtue, of their ability to control events, and of the future. By looking at this bias--called "positive illusions"--as it figures in evolutionary biology, psychology, and the politics of international conflict, this book offers compelling insights into why states wage war. </p><p> </p><p> Johnson traces the effects of positive illusions on four turning points in twentieth-century history: two that erupted into war (World War I and Vietnam); and two that did not (the Munich crisis and the Cuban missile crisis). Examining the two wars, he shows how positive illusions have filtered into politics, causing leaders to overestimate themselves and underestimate their adversaries--and to resort to violence to settle a conflict against unreasonable odds. In the Munich and Cuban missile crises, he shows how lessening positive illusions may allow leaders to pursue peaceful solutions. </p><p> </p><p> The human tendency toward overconfidence may have been favored by natural selection throughout our evolutionary history because of the advantages it conferred--heightening combat performance or improving one's ability to bluff an opponent. And yet, as this book suggests--and as the recent conflict in Iraq bears out--in the modern world the consequences of this evolutionary legacy are potentially deadly. </p></p><p>Dominic Johnson is Alistair Buchan Professor of International Relations in the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Oxford.Dominic Johnson shows that international conflicts need not escalate into long, costly wars -- if decision-makers rely on well-vetted information and avoid wishful thinking. He provides a lucid, convincing analysis of the disastrous consequences when normal confidence gives way to arrogance, causing leaders to believe their own propaganda, assume superiority, and deny facts. (Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Harvard Business School Professor and author of <i>Confidence: How Winning Streaks and Losing Streaks Begin and End</i>)<br><br><i>Overconfidence and War</i> is a fascinating and insightful analysis. Its skillful blend of history, psychology, and evolutionary biology is a model for a new kind of social analysis, one that will have increasing prominence in the years to come. (Steven Pinker, author of <i>How the Mind Works</i> and <i>The Blank Slate</i>)<br><br>The puzzle of why countries go to war is a puzzle only for those who assume that humans are calculating machines. Dominic Johnson provides a scientific foundation for understanding how humans really make decisions about the most important questions they face. We need more books like <i>Overconfidence and War.</i> (Stephen Peter Rosen, Harvard University)<br><br>This is an important book, both timely and of enduring value. It traces in detail the dreadful connection between self-deception and human warfare and suggests the kinds of thinking we must guard against if we are to avoid war. Read this book in hopes of a better, more conscious day-a day when we will not blunder so easily and stupidly off the first cliff inviting us to war. (Robert Trivers)<br><br>Dominic Johnson's attack on the war puzzle is novel, convincing, and appealing. Steeped in sound biology and a detailed account of key well-documented conflicts, <i>Overconfidence and War</i> marks an important advance in the long-anticipated integration of political science and evolutionary theory. (Richard Wrangham, co-author of <i>Demonic Males</i>)<br><br>Johnson applies the logic of evolution to international relations. Following one of his mentors, the Harvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham, he suggests that overconfidence might once have been helpful in war and conflict. On the ancient African savannah, it was actually rational to misestimate your own capacities: a fearsome appearance and bold tactics could intimidate the enemy and help carry the day during lightning raids on enemy camps. But today, given modern weaponry, bureaucratic planning and mass armies, a cocky disposition is as likely to be suicidal as it is glorious. Military overconfidence, in other words, is a psychological holdover--a cognitive appendix--from an earlier period in human history. It is perhaps most dangerous when it prompts a decision for war in the first place. And it could be the X-factor explaining the otherwise inexplicable in recent military history: French faith in the Maginot line, Hitler's drive into Russia, the American failure to heed the lessons of French defeat in Vietnam. Most humans are prone to overestimating themselves, but leaders (who are inordinately ambitious and, by definition, have suffered few recent professional setbacks) are especially susceptible. Fittingly, the cover of Johnson's book features George W. Bush in the famous flight suit, flashing an exuberant thumbs-up.

McClellan: Selected Correspondence, 1860-1865</h2><p>Gathers letters by the Civil War General in which he discusses the war, specific campaigns, and American politics</p><p><b>Stephen W. Sears</b> is the author of <i>The Civil War Papers of George B. McClellan</i>, <i>Landscape Turned Red: The Battle of Antietam, To the Gates of Richmond: The Peninsula Campaign,</i> and <i>Chancellorsville.</i> He lives in Connecticut.The author of Landscape Turned Red: The Battle of Antietam and a biography of McClellan here presents previously unpublished military dispatches and personal letters that show this "Young Napoleon" in a wide variety of wartime roles: army commander, military executive, strategist, tactician, political partisan and presidential can didate. McClellan's gross over-estimates of Confederate strength and his conviction that the administration in Washington failed to support him are two of the familiar themes brought into clearer focus. Of special note are McClellan's uninhibited letters to his wife, Mary Ellen, in which the general's contempt for President Lincoln, his policies and his advisers is on vivid display. After Lincoln replaced him as commander of the Army of the Potomac (following the missed opportunity to win a decisive victory at Antietam), McClellan was nominated by the Democratic party in the 1864 presidential election. The pertinent letters reveal, among other things, that McClellan devoted most of his campaign efforts to a futile attempt to win the army vote. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Voices in the Night: Stories</h2><p>From the Pulitzer and Story Prize winner: sixteen new stories&#x2014;provocative, funny, disturbing, enchanting&#x2014;that delve into the secret lives and desires of ordinary people, alongside retellings of myths and legends that highlight the aspirations of the human spirit.<br><br> Beloved for the lens of the strange he places on small town life, Steven Millhauser further reveals in <i>Voices in the Night</i> the darkest parts of our inner selves to brilliant and dazzling effect. Here are stories of wondrously imaginative hyperrealism, stories that pose unforgettably unsettling what-ifs, or that find barely perceivable evils within the safe boundaries of our towns, homes, and even within our bodies. <br><br> Here, too, are stories culled from religion and fables: Samuel, who hears the voice of God calling him in the night; a young, pre-enlightenment Buddha, who searches for his purpose in life; Rapunzel and her Prince, who struggle to fit the real world to their dream. <br><br> Heightened by magic, the divine, and the uncanny, shot through with sly and winning humor, <i>Voices in the Night</i> seamlessly combines the whimsy and surprise of the familiar with intoxicating fantasies that take us beyond our daily lives, all done with the hallmark sleight of hand and astonishing virtuosity of one of our greatest contemporary storytellers.</p><p>STEVEN MILLHAUSER is the author of numerous works of fiction, including <i>Martin Dressler,</i> which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, and, most recently, <i>We Others: New and Selected Stories,</i> winner of the Story Prize and a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award. His work has been translated into seventeen languages, and his story &#x201c;Eisenheim the Illusionist&#x201d; was the basis of the 2006 film <i>The Illusionist.</i> He teaches at Skidmore College and lives in Saratoga Springs, New York.&#x201c;Wondrous. Millhauser&nbsp;wants to startle us, and with his latest collection, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author does just that&#x2014;re-examining fairy tales, folktales and, not least of all, our shared perception of Small Town, USA. Phantoms plague residents in one town; a mermaid washes ashore in another. Few authors would dare retell the story of Rapunzel, but Millhauser attempts it. In &#x2018;American Tall Tale,&#x2019; Paul Bunyan engages in a sleeping contest with his brother, James, a &#x2018;do-nothing dreamer.&#x2019; Millhauser is unique among contemporary short-story writers: he&#x2019;s unconcerned with topical subjects or what&#x2019;s trendy. Instead, his eerie, atmospheric tales remind us of&nbsp;Edgar Allan Poe&nbsp;and the brothers Grimm. Millhauser&#x2019;s stories feel as if they&#x2019;d been composed in a distant era, magically delivered from the past to mystify and delight.&#x201d; &#x2013;Don Waters, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>&#x201c;Spellbinding, masterly, sublime . . . <i>Voices in the Night </i>abounds with marvels. The stories are anchored by dark human yearnings&#x2014;for perfection, or excitement, or some ungraspable form of fulfillment. These yearnings have a combustible quality. Beware the uncanny magic of Millhauser: Just when you think you recognize a myth, a character, a voice, the familiar tacks toward the strange and unexpected . . . His flexible voice allows for many a quantum leap. The title story, brief as it is, offers a whole universe through the pinhole of a single memory. Millhauser gives us worlds upon worlds&#x2014;wistful and warped, comic and chilling&#x2014;that by story&#x2019;s end, feel as intimate as our own reflections.&#x201d; &#x2014;Tania James, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sixteen stories, from new versions of classics like Rapunzel, to modern-day tales where humdrum, everyday life becomes something quite different&#x2014;when the normal moves, sometimes slowly and sometimes swiftly, into the strange. . . . Millhauser&#x2019;s stories bristle with humanity. And the way he moves slowly, almost stealthily toward his conclusions, is a marvel to watch and a pleasure to read.&#x201d; &#x2014;Dale Singer, <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i><br><br>&#x201c;The Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and short-story writer Millhauser, celebrated for exploring the strangeness lurking in everyday life, riff[s] on classic and religious fables. His inventiveness shows no sign of waning . . . Throughout the collection, he veers into the realm of fantasy with unsettling and mordantly funny results.&#x201d; &#x2014;Carmela Ciuraru, <i>The New York Times</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Masterful . . . intriguing and disturbingly intoxicating. Millhauser&#x2019;s readers have grown accustomed to [his] spectacular feats of literary derring-do thanks to a splendid four-decade career spent enriching the world with narratives that trigger every possible emotion . . . Many of the stories in <i>Voices in the Night</i> are set in Millhauserian towns where romantic nostalgia dukes it out with disquieting realities; characters must process their encounters with the uncanny without breaking their rose-colored glasses. <i>Voices in the Night</i> contains its share of fairy tales, too, [where] mystical happenings are not unexpected, but remain unnerving . . . In this collection, Millhauser&#x2019;s feats are just as outsize as Paul Bunyan&#x2019;s.&#x201d; &#x2014;Eugenia Williamson, <i>The Boston Globe</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A master storyteller. <i>Voices in the Night </i>offers 16 new stories with much to appreciate. He tackles tall tales, fairy tales, mermaids and baseball . . . . Millhauser is frequently whimsical and often funny, but he tackles serious subjects. There&#x2019;s a lot of death and finality swirling around <i>Voices in the Night, </i>but don&#x2019;t let that scare you. Millhauser doesn&#x2019;t tell readers what to think about these heavy themes; he just writes clever stories that make it impossible not to think about them. Unforgettable. Four stars.&#x201d; &#x2014;M. Scott Krause, <i>Vegas Seven</i> <br><br>&#x201c;Millhauser has long excelled at the three major forms of fiction, but <i>Voices in the Night s</i>hould fix his&nbsp;reputation as one of the two or three best short story writers alive in America . . . What separates his short fiction from that of his contemporaries is [that] his fictions are unabashedly thought-experiments meant to lead the mind and spirit down a dangerous path toward pseudo-collective hysteria (&#x2018;Arcadia&#x2019; [is] one of the funniest American stories I&#x2019;ve read in the last ten years), encroaching mania, epistemological blindness, communal oblivion, Emersonian philosophical splintering, and the vertigo of rumor. The stories are hilarious in the vein of Kafka, magical&#x2014;that is to say not really magical at all&#x2014;in the vein of Bruno Schulz, formally daring in the mode of Poe and Borges, although these similarities have been overstated. And they are written, this time around, firmly in the spirit of Hawthorne. That is to say they are twice-told, in the vein of Shakespeare&#x2019;s &#x2018;Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale,/Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man&#x2019; . . . It&#x2019;s a welcome thing that these signs and wonders and experiments, these invitations into the fold of American madness, are extended on every page of&nbsp;<i>Voices in the Night</i>. This is&nbsp;especially true when the mania of so much American fiction is cosmetic&#x2014;when so many writers are playing the game rather than fashioning it themselves.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jonathan Sturgeon, <i>Flavorwire</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Brilliant . . . powerful. Each work is a delight and revelation. Beautifully made fantastic tales such as Millhauser writes don't begin from nothing. As in the tradition of Nikolai Gogol, Italo Calvino and Gabriel Garcia Marquez (to name a few revered creators of fiction that carries us beyond the normal), most of them grow out of everyday incidents and lead us right up to the line between the ordinary and the magical. And sometimes they help us to cross over . . . But this collection it isn't just a regional fantasia, all stories about the other side of normal small-town life . . . Let's call [them] borderline pieces&#x2014;easily described as magical realism, or perhaps, turned on their heads, tales of realistic magic. However we might describe it, <i>Voices in the Night</i>&nbsp;is a smorgasbord of deftly created short fiction by a great imaginative talent. Millhauser stands tall in the company of a growing number of contemporary American masters of magic, from Ursula K. Le Guin to Aimee Bender and Kelly Link. To use his own plain, down-home metaphor, Millhauser has polished his mirrors in the halls and bedrooms and bathrooms and elsewhere, and it will do us all good to take a look at the reflections the glass throws back at us.&#x201d; &#x2013;Alan Cheuse, <i>National Public Radio</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A tour de force . . . What happens to a small town when something strange and supernatural takes over? Pulitzer Prize-winning author Millhauser explores that intersection of familiar life and disturbing, often bizarre events in <i>Voices in the Night.&#x201d; &#x2014;Arun Rath, National Public Radio<br></i><br>&#x201c;Pulitzer Prize winner Millhauser imbues classic fables with a hyperrealistic sensibility in this collection of 16 stories. In his capable hands, figures like Rapunzel, Buddha, and Paul Bunyan assume new and dazzling nuances.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Time</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Evanescent and bloody, obsessive and meditative, historical and futuristic, dystopian and romantic: Millhauser's brilliant work thrives in the fecund, mucky cracks of human contradictions. The stories in&nbsp;<i>Voices in the Night&nbsp;</i>revise traditional tales, entwine shadows of individual terror and community panic, and dazzle with nimble allegory. Millhauser's characters seek improvement, order and happiness, usually finding or making trouble in the process . . . He plays fluidly across genre&#x2014;gothic, horror, hyperrealism, fables&#x2014;and evokes not only his acknowledged influences, Nabokov and Mann, but also Poe, Calvino, Borges and Millet. In these stories he savors the perverse, morbid and dark; yet some tales add lighter touches to scriptural history and the fairy canon. His virtuosity is evident.&#x201d; &#x2014;Valerie Miner,&nbsp;<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;American literature never had a magical realist tradition to call its own, but it&#x2019;s always had writers eager to blur reality and the metaphysical . . . For decades Millhauser has [been] our national laureate of the weirdness of our normal lives. The stories in his masterful new collection riff on advertising copy, board reports, mythology and sports announcing. But within that breadth of styles he consistently prompts the reader to sense some shadowy but important news that&#x2019;s about to be delivered . . . He isn&#x2019;t concerned with death so much as with the elements of human nature that are hard to articulate or that speak to our fears. It&#x2019;s why [here] he&#x2019;s written stories on the long spiritual transformation of Buddha and the prophet Samuel, or riffed on fairy tales, tall tales and mythology . . . Millhauser doesn&#x2019;t deliver a firm moral lesson&#x2014;he is the last writer who&#x2019;d have a problem with us perceiving our world differently.&nbsp;<i>Voices in the Night</i>is defined by its playfulness; Millhauser tweaks genres and expectations like a carnival strongman bending steel bars. He is also the last writer who&#x2019;d have a problem with abandoning the laws of physics&#x2014;if he can make a good story out of it.&#x201d; &#x2014;Mark Athitakis, Minneapolis&nbsp;<i>Star Tribune<br> </i><br> &#x201c;Masterful, imaginative, impressive . . . Millhauser covers much ground in this collection. Many stories are set in small towns, with comfortably recognizable characteristics. Yet each has its own twist; something slightly askew whereby a single complication, placed under closer scrutiny, turns into a revelatory experience . . . The humor is first-rate, tickling the brain until the build-up explodes into irresistible laugh-out-loud funny. Millhauser's writing is impeccably fluid, while sneakily deceiving. For hiding beneath what seem to be easy, flowing, and uncomplicated tales, which include our funny quirks, odd ways, and frail vulnerabilities, lies our deeper shared commonality of desires, fears, and needs. The stories are well balanced, resisting any danger of becoming heavy-handed or too philosophical. Rather, they quietly draw us in, ultimately coaxing us closer to embrace the characters&#x2014;and ourselves&#x2014;in a more honest light.&#x201d; &#x2014;Peter Fritz,<i>Everyday eBook</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In several stories [the] acclaimed Millhauser doesn&#x2019;t so much defend the pervasiveness of unexplained phenomena in everyday existence as slyly report it. In off-kilter accounts of how ordinary life unravels mystically in small towns, and strange goings-on subtly or dramatically alter the townspeople&#x2019;s behavior, he deploys a unnamed narrator&#x2014;dutifully generous with details&#x2014;who reports legend and fact with equal avidity. And what legends they are . . . Millhauser is a supremely gifted miniaturist. For nearly 40 years, he has pursued a career as a writer of short stories and novellas that has yielded an impressive body of work . . . Dating back to his first book,&nbsp;he has explored, and cleverly exploited, that strange moment when realism veers or erodes into fantasy. In&nbsp;<i>Voices in the Night</i>, with its preponderance of concerned citizens faithfully reporting dissolution on Main Street through the mystical and macabre, Millhauser comes on like the bizarro world Sarah Orne Jewett we&#x2019;ve all been waiting for, even if we didn&#x2019;t know it. Unlike collections that strive [for] a mostly unified voice,&nbsp;<i>Voices in the Night</i>&nbsp;is a protean work that collects at least a half-dozen distinct voices . . . A worthy collection from a master of an increasingly rare art.&#x201d; &#x2014;Steve Nathans-Kelly,&nbsp;<i>Paste</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Captivating stories, whose decidedly fantastic perspective on what we like to think of as ordinary life infuses mundane existence with a persistent sense of mystery and wonder. Millhauser's gift lies in his ability to maintain plausibility while at the same time allowing surreal qualities to flourish . . . &nbsp;In these enchanting, unsettling stories, Millhauser bursts the boundaries of the world we think we know, to help us see it anew.&#x201d; &#x2014;Harvey Freedenberg,&nbsp;<i>Shelf Awareness</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The towns in Millhauser&#x2019;s stories are haunted. The characters&#x2014;nearly all of them&#x2014;are frenzied. They see phantoms, they fixate on surreal happenings, they hear voices in the night. But Millhauser isn&#x2019;t a horror writer; his latest collection elegantly toes the line between the real and the surreal, and many of the stories examine how we attempt to collectively explain the unexplainable . . . He is calling attention to the value of storytelling, as opposed to cut-and-dry fact-gathering, as a means of conveying truth . . .&nbsp;Like Fox Mulder, or even Wes Anderson, Millhauser is a delightfully playful truth-seeker who uses factual language not as a definitive descriptior, but as a jumping-off point for fuller understanding.&nbsp;<i>Voices in the Night</i>&nbsp;expertly toes the line between the real and surreal&#x2014;and thoughtfully examines how we talk about, and document, the latter . . . Whimsical, fantastical, macabre.&#x201d; &#x2014;Maddie Crum,&nbsp;<i>The Huffington Post</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mind-boggling wonders receive calm scrutiny in the fiction of Steven Millhauser. His tone can be comical, eerie or some slippery combination of the two . . . He enchants you.&nbsp; The closing story, &#x2018;A Voice in the Night,&#x2019; is quite unlike anything else he's done, as it cycles through three permutations of the same story: the Biblical tale of Samuel being called by the voice of God; a 20th-century youngster's experience of reading and pondering that Bible story; and a 68-year-old author reflecting on how the story has resounded for him over six decades. It's as close to straightforward autobiography as Millhauser has ever come&#x2014;and it feels like a key to his whole narrative universe . . . These 16 stories find him at the peak of his powers.&#x201d; &#x2014;Michael Upchurch,&nbsp;<i>The Oregonian</i><br><br> &#x201c;Vividly imaginative . . . In this new collection, Pulitzer Prize-winner Millhauser draws a gauzy curtain of hyper-reality over mundane events and creates an atmosphere of uneasiness that accelerates to dread. He establishes tense yet wondrous tones while never resorting to melodrama; his cool, restrained voice is profoundly effective . . . The gem of the collection is &#x2018;A Voice in the Night,&#x2019; in which a young boy in the author&#x2019;s own home town is transfixed by the biblical story of Samuel, who heard God&#x2019;s voice and knew he must obey . . . The cumulative effect [of] the voices throughout is to transport the reader to an alternate world in which the uncanny lurks pervasively beneath the surface.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly&nbsp;</i><br><br> &#x201c;A master storyteller continues to navigate the blurry space between magic and reality in 16 comic, frightening, consistently off-kilter tales. Millhauser emerged in the '70s with his sensibility fully formed, taking Bernard Malamud&#x2019;s heady mixture of Jewish mysticism and urban life and expanding its reach to encompass palace courts and big-box suburbia. In this collection [he] complicat[es] our notions of suburban comfort [and] as ever [is] an incessant tinkerer with ages-old myths, fairy tales and religious stories: Among the best entries here are &#x2018;The Pleasures and Sufferings of Young Gautama,&#x2019; a tale of the young Buddha that pits foursquare language with its hero&#x2019;s roiling spiritual despair, and irreverent tweaks of tales about Paul Bunyan,&nbsp;Rapunzel, mermaids and the prophet Samuel. Millhauser intuits modes of storytelling like nobody else, and even his satire of sports-announcer&#x2013;speak in &#x2018;Home Run&#x2019; elevates the quotidian to the cosmic.&nbsp;A superb testament to America&#x2019;s quirkiest short story writer, still on his game.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Kirkus</i>&nbsp;(starred review)<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Hollow Earth: The Greatest Geographical Discovery in History Made by Admiral Richard E.

The present volume traces into this decade the multiphasic transformation of educative institutions in the United Statessettlement houses, libraries, museums, as well as schools and collegesand spotlights such seminal agents of change as Margaret Mead and John Dewey in an overview that visualizes the configurations of education in the 20th century. The urbanization of the United States, the social and industrial complexities of the technological age made far-reaching demands on education. The author cites the variety of institutionalized responses to new needs but maintains "there was the ubiquitous and incessant education implicit in the very nature of metropolitan life," which has effects reaching far beyond our continental confines. Cremin's historiographical mode makes important educational history accessible to a wide audience. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Furniture of the American Arts and Crafts Movement: Furniture Made by Gustav Stickley, L. &amp; J.G.

"No other building of the ancient world," claims the Anchor Bible Dictionary, "either while it stood in Jerusalem or in the millennia since its final destruction has been the focus of so much attention throughout the ages."<br><br>This stunning book, with its 160 illustrations, is a history of the Temple or Temples in Jerusalem from Solomon's time to the present.

Starting with a discussion of the Palestinian denial of a Jewish Temple, the book proceeds to explore the Islamic Dome of the Rock, the little-known Roman Temple of Jupiter, Herod's massive Temple Mount, the Temple built by the exiles returning from Babylon, and finally Solomon's Temple.

In the person of Willy Loman, the aging, failing salesman who makes his living riding on a smile and a shoeshine, Arthur Miller redefined the tragic hero as a man whose dreams are at once insupportably vast and dangerously insubstantial. He has given us a figure whose name has become a symbol for a kind of majestic grandiosity&#x2014;and a play that compresses epic extremes of humor and anguish, promise and loss, between the four walls of an American living room.<br><br> "By common consent, this is one of the finest dramas in the whole range of the American theater." &#x2014;Brooks Atkinson, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br> "So simple, central, and terrible that the run of playwrights would neither care nor dare to attempt it." &#x2014;<i>Time<br><br></i>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>Arthur Miller's 1949 <i>Death of a Salesman</i> has sold 11 million copies, and Willy Loman didn't make all those sales on a smile and a shoeshine. This play is the genuine article--it's got the goods on the human condition, all packed into a day in the life of one self-deluded, self-promoting, self-defeating soul. It's a sturdy bridge between kitchen-sink realism and spectral abstraction, the facts of particular hard times and universal themes. As Christopher Bigsby's mildly interesting afterword in this 50th-anniversary edition points out (as does Miller in his memoir, <i>Timebends</i>), Willy is closely based on the playwright's sad, absurd salesman uncle, Manny. But of course Miller made Manny into Everyman, and gave him the name of the crime commissioner Lohmann in Fritz Lang's angst-ridden 1932 Nazi parable, <i>The Testament of Dr. Mabuse</i>.<p> The tragedy of Loman the all-American dreamer and loser works eternally, on the page as on the stage. A lot of plays made history around 1949, but none have stepped out of history into the classic canon as <i>Salesman</i> has. Great as it was, Tennessee Williams's work can't be revived as vividly as this play still is, all over the world. (This edition has edifying pictures of Lee J. Cobb's 1949 and Brian Dennehy's 1999 performances.) It connects Aristotle, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, <i>On the Waterfront</i>, David Mamet, and the archetypal American movie antihero. It even transcends its author's tragic flaw of pious preachiness (which undoes his snoozy <i>The Crucible</i>, unfortunately his most-produced play).</p><p> No doubt you've seen Willy Loman's story at least once. It's still worth reading. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Stacy Keach and Jane Kaczmarek stars in Arthur Miller's 1949 masterpiece, a searing portrait of the physical, emotional, and psychological costs of the American dream. Willy Loman (Keach) is the play's iconic traveling salesman, whose family is torn apart by his desperate obsession with greatness and social acceptance. As his two sons cast about aimlessly for their station in life, Willy begins to come unraveled when the reality of his life threatens his long-cherished illusions. <p> A full cast L.A.

Captured only a few days earlier, U.S. Navy Lieutenant (junior grade) Porter Halyburton didn&#x2019;t know the consequences if he continued to withhold military information. He was already locked inside North Vietnam&#x2019;s notorious Hoa Lo Prison, dubbed the Hanoi Hilton&#x201d; by the Americans, a forbidding trapezoidal structure with thick outer walls topped by barbed wire and jagged glass. Years of urine, blood, and vomit permeated the rotting crevices. The food included chicken feet and bread so moldy that it had begun to ferment. Even the prison&#x2019;s name suggested its hellishness Hoa Lo (pronounced wa-low&#x201d;) means fiery furnace&#x201d; in Vietnamese.<br> Whatever was worse&#x201d; would certainly be terrible, Halyburton thought, but still not as abhorrent as assisting the enemy.<br> At twenty-four, Halyburton was one of the younger American POWs in Vietnam. His six-foot frame, short brown hair, and wholesome good looks fit the prototype of the dashing fighter jock,&#x201d; whose love of danger and combat had been immortalized in .lm and literature. But Halyburton was also introspective and artistic, the product of a small college town that had nurtured his intellectual and creative pursuits. He wrote poems, carved wooden statues, and read widely on history and culture. He was also a family man, having married his college sweetheart. The couple&#x2019;s baby daughter was born four weeks before he left for Vietnam.<br> He was lucky to be alive. On October 17, 1965, his F-4 Phantom jet was shot down forty miles northeast of Hanoi, killing the pilot in a fiery explosion. Halyburton, the backseat&#x201d; navigator, ejected without injury. Among many combat aviators, it was an article of faith that they would rather die instantly in a crash than be caught by the enemy. Halyburton believed otherwise, but he soon realized that the price of survival would be high.<br> Immediately after his capture he was sent to Hoa Lo, where his cell, seven feet by six, had a boarded window, a single dim light bulb, and a concrete bed with leg irons. Cockroaches darted through the cells, and rats, some over a foot long, prowled the premises, lending evidence to a postwar POW study that noted, After sundown, rats and mice literally took over North Vietnam.&#x201d; Scribbled across the faded whitewashed walls were Vietnamese letters, but so too was something more comforting the name of an American, Ron Storz. Halyburton wasn&#x2019;t isolated or completely deprived; he could whisper to Americans in adjoining cells and was allowed to shower. Interrogations became a part of daily life: he was questioned by Colonel Nam, a gray-haired Vietnamese commander called Eagle for his authoritarian manner. Using passable English, he offered Halyburton the carrot or the stick. It was his choice.<br> Better place, worse place,&#x201d; Eagle intoned repeatedly.<br> Halyburton only disclosed the information prescribed by the Code of Conduct for captured American servicemen: Porter Halyburton,&#x201d; he said. Lieutenant j.g., 617514, 16 January 1941.&#x201d; Further quizzes,&#x201d; as they were called, produced the same response, so after two weeks a guard went to Halyburton&#x2019;s cell one night, blindfolded and handcuffed him, and walked him to a truck, which rumbled a couple of miles to the outskirts of Hanoi. He was left at the Cu Loc Prison, believed to be a former French .lm studio where the grounds were still littered with old film cans, ducks and chickens roamed, and mosquitoes buzzed. A large putrid swimming pool lay thick with water, dirt, garbage, and fish that the Vietnamese guards raised for food. When Halyburton was pushed into his pitch-black cell, he pressed his hands against the walls to discover its dimensions. The room, though relatively large each wall was fifteen feet long was indeed worse than his previous cell. There was no bed, no light, its window was bricked up, and it smelled of wet concrete. But at least Halyburton could still use a tap code to communicate with the POWs in adjacent cells. He was not alone.<br> The harassment, however, continued. In the quiz room, Halyburton sat on a stool that forced him to look up at his new interrogator, a surly, jug- eared official nicknamed Rabbit, who called the American an air pirate&#x201d; and a war criminal.&#x201d; He made the same threat better place, worse place&#x201d; if Halyburton did not reveal the names of his ship, squadron, and plane, but the prisoner didn&#x2019;t give in. The threat was fulfilled: days later, he was moved across the commpound to a remote storage room in the back of an auditorium. Once again feeling his way in the darkness, he discovered that this space wwwwwas only five feet by eight. What&#x2019;s more, it was isolated, preventing any communication with other Americans. That scared him. Except for interrogations, the only time he left the cell was to empty his waste bucket, and there was no more bathing. The questioning had become more abusive; Halyburton was repeatedly harangued ( Bad attitude! Bad attitude!&#x201d;) and slapped across the head.<br> He sought comfort through prayer. He did not ask for freedom, for food, or for any material comforts. He asked for strength to survive, for companionship, and for the safety of his family. He found inspiration, literally, from above.<br> One morning he noticed a beam of sunlight filtering through the shutters in his cell and arcing across his cement wall. The next morning he saw the light strike the same place. So he tore a piece of coarse brown toilet paper into the shape of a cross and used rice to stick it on the cement. The following morning the light slowly passed over the cross a radiant signal from God, Halyburton thought. He gratefully whispered the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer.<br> But the solace didn&#x2019;t last. Halyburton continued to refuse to provide military information and was again taken to a worse place,&#x201d; this time to a nearby shed. It had two rooms, but he was confined to one that was again five feet by eight. The place had once stored coal and was later designated by the Americans as the outhouse&#x201d; or shithouse.&#x201d; A few holes in the ceiling and space beneath the door supplied scant ventilation, and coal dust covered the floor. Through cracks in the wall, Halyburton could see other Americans walking together in the compound, and he didn&#x2019;t understand why he had been singled out for isolation and mistreatment. Had the other POWs cooperated with the enemy to receive better treatment? In captivity for a month, he had lost twenty-five pounds and had developed dysentery. It was now late November and cold, and his mosquito net provided flimsy refuge from the insects&#x2019; nightly assaults. The interrogations also continued: Halyburton was questioned about his life as well as the war.<br> Where do you live?&#x201d; What are your parents&#x2019; names?&#x201d; Do you have a family?&#x201d; By now, the Vietnamese had discovered on Halyburton&#x2019;s flight vest the names of his squadron and ship, and they knew that he was married and from North Carolina, which he assumed they had learned from U.S. newspapers. That information, in enemy hands, felt like one more violation, and Halyburton feared he was breaking down mentally as well as physically.<br> But he hadn&#x2019;t broken, and he still refused to answer questions beyond his name, rank, serial number, and date of birth. Rabbit presented the familiar choice: Better place, worse place.&#x201d; Halyburton didn&#x2019;t respond and was taken back to his filthy cell.<br> He slumped down in despair. He doubted the Vietnamese would purposely kill him. Dead, he was useless to them; alive, he could still, in theory, provide military information or propaganda statements. But Halyburton knew he could perish from abuse or neglect, and it occurred to him that his isolation could doom him to an ignominious end. He could die in his cell, quietly, with the geckos, rats, and mosquitoes whose musty space he had shared. His death would be one more inconvenience for his Vietnamese guard, who twice a day received rations for the prisoner but waited at least an hour before sliding the food in, allowing ants to infest the rice and cool air to congeal the pig fat in the watery soup. His death would be his final deliverance, but beyond the enemy, who would even know?<br> The lock turned and the wooden door swung open, allowing the guard and a commander to enter. It was November 28, nighttime, forty-two days after Halyburton&#x2019;s plane had been shot down. He knew that a visit at this hour meant he would be moved to another cell a worse place but he wasn&#x2019;t sure how much more he could endure. He used his blanket to roll up his mosquito net, some clothes, a tin cup, and his toothbrush, and he followed the guard and interrogator through the compound. The air was cool and refreshing, and the soft grass massaged his bare feet. Something was alive, he thought, something that wasn&#x2019;t caked with dirt. They walked about thirty yards, turned left, and approached a one-story building known as the Office,&#x201d; whose five rooms had been converted to prison cells. It was, in fact, the same building he had initially been taken to. They went up two concrete steps and reached the door to cell number one. Halyburton&#x2019;s mind raced with thoughts about the misery that awaited him. What could be worse than a dark, claustrophobic room with coal dust, rats, and lizards?<br> The door opened, and Halyburton walked inside. A faint bulb emitted just enough light for him to see a man sitting on a teak board that served as a bed. He was thin, unwashed, unshaven, and injured, his left foot wrapped in a cast and his left arm hanging in a sling. He was black.<br> You must take care of Cherry,&#x201d; the guard said.<br> The door was slammed shut. After a long pause, the newcomer stepped forward.<br> I&#x2019;m Porter Halyburton. I&#x2019;m a Navy j.g. F-4. Backseater.&#x201d; Major Fred Cherry,&#x201d; the black officer said. Air Force. F-105 Thunderchief.&#x201d; Halyburton soon realized that his new torment had nothing to do with grimy cells, unpalatable food, or sadistic guards. His new punishment the worse place&#x201d; was to care for a black man.<br><br>The Vietnam War was the longest in U.S. history and, with more than 58,000 Americans killed, the third deadliest. It was also a wrecking ball through American society, igniting passionate protests in town squares and campuses, radicalizing a youth movement, tormenting political leaders, and stymieing a great military that could not subdue a peasant nation. It spawned cynicism toward public institutions, disdain for veterans, and doubt about America&#x2019;s role in the world. By the time the war ended in January of 1973, most Americans had concluded that the effort had been ill defined and poorly executed, and the country would spend the rest of the century debating the lessons of Vietnam.&#x201d; But on one matter there was no debate the POWs. When the Democratic Republic of Vietnam released 591 U.S. prisoners at war&#x2019;s end, their return represented a singular accomplishment in a conflict without defining victories or tangible gains. The POWs&#x2019; sacrifice, perseverance, and patriotism were celebrated by countrymen whose faith in the armed services and in America itself had been shaken. The returning prisoners were feted at the White House, saluted at homecoming parades, and acclaimed as heroes. California&#x2019;s governor Ronald Reagan said: You gave America back its soul God bless a country that can produce men like you.&#x201d; For all the attention they received, the number of POWs in Vietnam was actually quite small compared to those from the century&#x2019;s other major wars (130,201 in World War II, for example, and 7,140 in the Korean War). Yet the fate of the Vietnam prisoners was a national melodrama, driven in part by the POWs&#x2019; wives, who orchestrated a savvy publicity campaign that pressured the country to place their husbands&#x2019; return at the center of any peace accord. The POW bracelet, launched by a private organization, was another brilliant publicity gambit that allowed Americans to view the captives as individuals and support them without endorsing the war itself.<br> Of course, some of the captured Americans did not return. At least eighty-four died in Southeast Asian prisons and jungle camps, usually from torture, untreated wounds, or execution. But the survival rate was high, given the abject living conditions and the sheer length of their confinement. Unlike common criminals in civilian prisons, the POWs were not serving a defined sentence. Their confinement was unknown and indefinite. Until Vietnam, no U.S. military prisoner had been held in captivity for more than four years, but the Vietnam War saw more than three hundred Americans incarcerated for five or more years; two men were held for nine years. Their experience had no precedent in American history.<br> The prisoners in Hanoi had a very different profile from those of the grunts fighting in South Vietnam. They were professional soldiers and tended to be older college graduates whose maturity and experience sustained them through the lowest moments of their ordeal. These officers found unity and strength by developing an elaborate military command structure, a secret communications network, and a rigorous code of conduct, and many returned with extraordinary tales of survival, overcoming years of abuse and privation while finding value in their own suffering.<br> But in the many personal narratives of courage and defiance, the story of Porter Halyburton and Fred Cherry stands apart. They were locked in the same cell because the Vietnamese believed their racial differences would torment them a not entirely nadve assumption. While the two officers were separated by age, rank, and military service, each man&#x2019;s race had produced a dramatically different life experience. Cherry, descended from a Virginia slave, was a pioneer in the integration of the armed services; though sustaining many racist slights along the way, he became one of the Air Force&#x2019;s best combat pilots. Halyburton, whose forefathers fought for the Confederacy, was raised in the segregated South, where blacks were poor, deferential, and inferior; his was not the virulent racism of the demagogue but the more insidious bigotry of condescension and paternalism.<br> Each man, ultimately, carved a distinctive legacy in Vietnam during a confinement of seven and a half years. Cherry was renowned for his resolve against the Vietnamese, who showed no mercy in trying to convince him that he should repudiate the American imperialists&#x201d; and support the colored people of Asia. Cherry suffered as much physical pain as any prisoner who survived, yet he appears to be the only tortured POW who never made concessions to the enemy. Halyburton was respected as a creative scholar, who invented such games as invisible bridge played without cards and whose imagination allowed him to find a meaningful life in the bleakest of settings.<br> Halyburton and Cherry returned home to very different circumstances, which mirrored the range of experience for all the POWs on their repatriation. Halyburton&#x2019;s wife, Marty, was initially told that he had been killed in action, and a memorial service was held to honor his memory. Sixteen months later, learning he was alive, she remained loyal to him, speaking out on his behalf and becoming stronger and more independent from the adversity. But Cherry&#x2019;s marriage, already on shaky ground when he was captured, did not survive. His wife quickly turned on him, spent his money, and splintered the family. Both the Halyburton and Cherry families learned, through years of estrangement, fear, and hope, that the inmates in Hanoi were not the only prisoners. We were all POWs,&#x201d; said Cherry&#x2019;s son, Fred Jr.<br> Halyburton and Cherry were in the sa...</p><h2>Fell's Official Know-It-All Guide: Health &amp; Wellness</h2><p>In this new edition of the bestseller Your Health, Your Choice, learn the ground breaking program that lets you choose the best foods for your body&#39;s chemistry.</p><p></p><h2>On Beulah Height (Dalziel and Pascoe Mysteries)</h2><p>"Reginald Hill," writes the <i>Dallas Morning News,</i> "is not only a talented writer of detective fiction, he is a shrewd observer of human nature."

Visit her website at <b>www.vivianvandevelde.com.</b></p>Grade 3-6-This "Words Take Wing" Repertory Company production of Vivian Vande Velde's humorous tongue-in- cheek fantasy (Crown, 1985) has mixed success. Listeners will enjoy the story of Jennifer, an impoverished princess who enters a forbidden enchanted forest with a handsome, self-centered prince who consistently makes bad decisions, acts upon them, and then blames others for the consequences. Jennifer is forced to seek help on her own when the prince falls under an enchantment. She meets a young sorcerer who, despite his limited powers, helps her outwit and overcome the various creatures and impediments to breaking the spell. The predominantly word-for-word (only some "he said, she said's" are omitted) reading of the story is adequate. Velde is the narrator, and while most of her reading is good, her marked accent with a flat "a" seems too down-to-earth and ill-suited to the playful fairy tale setting of the story. In addition, her pacing sometimes does not flow smoothly; she pauses between phrases and words that do not require pauses. The actors who read the dialogue play their parts well, but listeners are always aware that they are acting and some may never be drawn totally into the story. The dramatization of the dialogue is almost distracting as it contrasts with the undramatic narration. Audio quality is good throughout. Despite its minor flaws, children will enjoy this production. With its humorous reversal of traditional fairy tale roles, it will provide good entertainment for group or individual listening.<br><i>Louise L. Sherman, Anna C.

Although it was to be a relatively short flight, they became lost. When the fuel ran low, they decided to ditch into the Pacific. Before they could get their life raft to inflate, however, the plane sank beneath them, carrying most of the survival gear down with it. Thirty-four days later the raft landed on Puka Puka, a New Zealand governed atoll in the Danger Islands, having meandered 1,200 miles!<p>The story of the voyage, with few resources except courage and indomitable human spirit, is not only inspiring listening, but a tribute to the human species and its will to survive.

On this occasion, the problem concerns a certain cow-creamer, that should have belonged to Uncle Tom, but, with the use of trickery, was purchased by Sir Watkyn Bassett. Aunt Dahlia insists that Bertie steal it back, but Sir Watkyn and his companion Rodrick Spode are on to him. To make matters worse, Stephanie Byng also has an ingenious plot to endear her fiance to her uncle (none other than Sir Watkyn) that entails Bertie stealing the cow-creamer. And she&#39;s willing to use blackmail.

Safe for them, that is. The only problem was that he still <i>needed</i> them, needed the sound of human voices and laughter. To his shame, he sometimes hovered on the edge of one of the campgrounds just to listen to the voices and pretend they were talking to him.</p><p>Which was a very small part of the reason that he was lying belly-down in the kinnikinnick and old tamarack needles in the shadow of a stand of trees, watching the young man who was writing with a pencil in a metal-bound notebook after taking a sample of the bear scat and storing the resultant partially filled plastic bag in his backpack.</p><p>Walter had no fear the boy would see him: Uncle Sam had ensured that Walter could hide and track, and decades of living alone in some of the most forbidding wilderness in the States had made him into a fair imitation of those miraculously invisible Indians who had populated the favorite books and movies of his childhood. If he didn&#x2019;t want to be seen, he wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;besides, the boy had all the woodcraft of a suburban housewife. They shouldn&#x2019;t have sent him into grizzly country on his own&#x2014;feeding grad students to the bears wasn&#x2019;t a good idea, might give them ideas.</p><p>Not that the bears were out today. Like Walter, they knew how to read the signs: sometime in the next four or five hours there was a big storm coming. He could feel it in his bones, and the stranger didn&#x2019;t have a big enough pack to be prepared for it. It was early for a winter storm, but this country was like that. He&#x2019;d seen it snow in August.</p><p>That storm was the other reason he was following the boy. The storm and what to do about it&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t often anymore that he was so torn by indecision.</p><p>He could let the kid go. The storm would come and steal away his life, but that was the way of the mountain, of the wilderness. It was a clean death. If only the grad student weren&#x2019;t so young. A lifetime ago he&#x2019;d seen so many boys die&#x2014;you&#x2019;d think he&#x2019;d have gotten used to it. Instead, one more seemed like one too many.</p><p>He could warn the boy. But everything in him rebelled at the thought. It had been too long since he&#x2019;d spoken face-to-face with anyone . . . even the thought made his breath freeze up.</p><p>It was too dangerous. Might cause another flashback&#x2014;he hadn&#x2019;t had one in a while&#x2014;but they crept up unexpectedly. It would be too bad if he tried to warn the boy and ended up killing him instead.</p><p>No. He couldn&#x2019;t risk the little peace he had by warning the stranger&#x2014;but he couldn&#x2019;t just let him die, either.</p><p>Frustrated, he&#x2019;d been following for a few hours as the boy blundered, oblivious, farther and farther from the nearest road and safety. The bedroll on his backpack made it clear he was planning on staying the night&#x2014;which ought to mean he thought he knew what he was doing in the woods. Unfortunately, it had become clearer and clearer it was a false confidence. It was like watching June Cleaver roughing it. Sad. Just sad.</p><p>Like watching the newbies coming into &#x2019;Nam all starched and ready to be men, when everyone knew that all they were was cannon fodder.</p><p>Damn boy was stirring up all sorts of things Walter liked to keep away. But the irritation wasn&#x2019;t strong enough to make a difference to Walter&#x2019;s conscience. Six miles, as near as he figured it, he&#x2019;d trailed the boy, unable to make up his mind: his preoccupation kept him from sensing the danger until the boy student stopped dead in the middle of the trail.</p><p>The thick brush between them only allowed him to see the top of the boy&#x2019;s backpack, and whatever stopped the boy was shorter. The good part was that it wasn&#x2019;t a moose. You could reason with a black bear&#x2014;even a grizzly if it wasn&#x2019;t hungry (which in his experience was seldom the case), but a moose was . . .</p><p>Walter drew his big knife, though he wasn&#x2019;t sure he&#x2019;d try to help the boy. Even a black bear was a quicker death than the storm would be&#x2014;if bloodier. And he knew the bear around here, which was more than he could say about the boy. He moved slowly through the brush, making no noise though fallen aspen leaves littered the ground. When he didn&#x2019;t want to make noise, he didn&#x2019;t make noise.</p><p>A low growl caused a shiver of fear to slice through him, sending his adrenaline into the ozone layer. It wasn&#x2019;t a sound he&#x2019;d ever heard here, and he knew every predator that lived in his territory.</p><p>Four feet farther and he had nothing impairing his view.</p><p>There in the middle of the path stood a dog&#x2014;or something doglike, anyway. At first he thought it was a German shepherd because of the coloring, but there was something wrong with the joints of its front end that made it look more like a bear than a dog. And it was bigger than any damned dog or wolf he&#x2019;d ever seen. It had cold eyes, killer&#x2019;s eyes, and impossibly long teeth.</p><p>Walter might not know what to call it, but he knew what it was. In that beast&#x2019;s face lurked every nightmare image that haunted his life. It was the thing he fought through two tours of &#x2019;Nam and every night since: death. This was a battle for a blooded warrior, battered and tainted as he was, not an innocent.</p><p>He broke cover with a wild whoop designed to attract attention and sprinted, ignoring the protest of knees grown too old for battle. It had been a long time since his last fight, but he had never forgotten the feeling of the blood pounding through his veins.</p><p>&#x201c;Run, kid,&#x201d; he said as he blazed past the boy with a fierce grin, prepared to engage the enemy.</p><p>The animal might run. It had taken its time sizing up the boy, and sometimes, when a predator&#x2019;s meal charges it, the predator will leave. But somehow he didn&#x2019;t think that this beast was such an animal&#x2014;there was an eerie intelligence in its blindingly gold eyes.</p><p>Whatever had kept it from attacking the boy immediately, it had no qualms about Walter. It launched itself at him as if he were unarmed. Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t as smart as he thought&#x2014;or it had been deceived by his grizzled exterior and hadn&#x2019;t realized what an old veteran armed with a knife as long as his arm could do. Maybe it was aroused by the boy&#x2019;s flight&#x2014;he&#x2019;d taken Walter&#x2019;s advice at face value and was running like a track star&#x2014;and just viewed Walter as an obstacle to its desire for fresh, tender meat.</p><p>But Walter wasn&#x2019;t a helpless boy. He&#x2019;d gotten the knife from so...</p></p><h2>Sempre: Redemption</h2><p>In this thrilling and sexy follow-up to <i>Sempre</i>, two young lovers struggle to keep their relationship intact after they become deeply enmeshed in the dangerous mafia-run crime ring they once tried to overthrow.<br><br><b>The electrifying sequel to <i>Sempre</i>!

Darhower lives in a tiny town in the Carolinas with her family.Sempre: Redemption <br> <br>1<br> <br>On October 12, at 11:56 in the evening, Corrado Alphonse Moretti died.<br> <br>There had been a strong lurching in his stomach and a sudden wooziness as blood gushed from the bullet wounds in his chest. Pain swept from his body like a rolling wave, numbness swallowing him whole. Everything blurred, sights and sounds distorted, as reality twisted and the world around him faded away.<br> <br>And then there was nothing.<br> <br>No bright lights. No gentle voices. No angelic presence. Only blackness. He heard nothing, he saw nothing, and he felt nothing. After everything Corrado had done in his life, he had expected hellfire and brimstone.<br> <br>He was a bit disappointed, to say the least.<br> <br>A few minutes later, at exactly midnight, Corrado was violently shocked back to life. His heart beat once again as oxygen saturated his body, but his newfound peace was instantly destroyed: The moment they brought him back into the world, ripping him from the darkness of afterlife, he was transported to a time he had long ago wished to forget.<br> <br>It was a decade earlier but only a few feet away from the small, dingy hospital room he now lay in, soiled with blood, sweat, and bitter tears. The room from ten years before had been filled with the same feeling&#x2014;heartbreak and misery, the harsh stench of imminent death thick in the air.<br> <br>Corrado stood quietly in the doorway that warm October day, his eyes fixed inside the sterile room. Carmine DeMarco had always been slightly small for his age, but he seemed so minuscule in the large hospital bed. Tubes and wires ran from his frail body to various machines surrounding him, their humming and beeping not enough to drown out the strangled voice in the corner.<br> <br>Vincent DeMarco sat near his son, rocking and frantically muttering to himself. Corrado had never seen him so out of control before, agitated and deranged almost like a feral animal. His sanity was slipping, his hair a dirty mess and his shirt soiled with blood. Vincent&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s blood, to be precise&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. blood that had been spilled less than twenty-four hours before.<br> <br>The sight of it sickened Corrado. It wasn&#x2019;t the first time he&#x2019;d seen Maura&#x2019;s blood, but it would certainly be the last. She was dead and never coming back, but Vincent was clearly struggling to accept the truth.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s can&#x2019;t be gone.&#x201d; The words caught in his throat. &#x201c;This is my fault.&#x201d;<br> <br>Corrado wanted to tell him to stop being absurd, but it would be a waste of breath. He couldn&#x2019;t comfort him. No words would take his pain away. And, truthfully, Corrado couldn&#x2019;t imagine the anguish his brother-in-law felt. He didn&#x2019;t fear death, didn&#x2019;t fear jail or eternal damnation, but one thing he couldn&#x2019;t fathom was losing Celia. He&#x2019;d vowed to honor her, to cherish her, to protect her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>It was no wonder Vincent was so quick to take the blame. He had failed at that&#x2014;he had failed to protect Maura.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my fault,&#x201d; Vincent repeated. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s gone, and it&#x2019;s my fault.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sighing, Corrado glanced back at his nephew. Carmine had been found near death behind Tarullo&#x2019;s Pizzeria. They didn&#x2019;t know what had happened yet, but one thing was clear: whoever ambushed them intended for the boy to die, too.<br> <br>That fact made Corrado feel even sicker. He had never been particularly fond of children, with their needy ways and grubby little hands, but one thing he treasured was innocence. He envied it. He had murdered many men during his years with La Cosa Nostra, but he prided himself on never killing anyone he felt didn&#x2019;t deserve his wrath.<br> <br>And staring at his nephew, so helpless and vulnerable, Corrado couldn&#x2019;t imagine what would possess someone to harm him. It was unheard of. Some things even the wickedest of men didn&#x2019;t tolerate, and killing a kid in cold blood was one of those things.<br> <br>Things were different now, though. As much as it infuriated him, times were changing, and he wondered what that meant for Carmine. At only eight years old, he had been thrown headfirst into the lifestyle. When he woke up&#x2014;if he did&#x2014;his world wouldn&#x2019;t be the same. Whether Carmine liked it or not, he couldn&#x2019;t escape the life. Not after this. He was now a part of it, and Corrado knew he would spend the rest of his life trying to make sense of the chaos.<br> <br>Hatred brewed in Corrado&#x2019;s gut, hot like molten lava. The longer he stood there, listening to the babble of a devastated man, the angrier he grew. All he could think about was getting revenge on the people who had hurt them. Not only did his vow to the organization demand it&#x2014;an eye for an eye&#x2014;but so did his weary heart.<br> <br>Corrado&#x2019;s heart, a decade later miraculously holding steady on the cardiac monitor, grew stronger every passing day. He would survive the shoot-out in the Chicago warehouse. The Kevlar Killer would live to see another day.<br> <br>On December 1, after being comatose for six weeks, Corrado Alphonse Moretti opened his eyes.</p><h2>The Search for Nefertiti: The True Story of an Amazing Discovery</h2><p>Her power was rivaled only by her beauty. Her face has become one of the most recognizable images in the world. She was an independent woman and thinker centuries before her time. But who was Egypt's Queen Nefertiti? <br> <br> After years of intense research, Dr. Joann Fletcher has answered the questions countless researchers before her could not. While studying Egyptian royal wigs, she read a brief mention of an unidentified and mummified body, discovered long ago and believed to belong to an Egyptian of little importance. This body happened to have a wig, which Dr. Fletcher knew was a clear sign of power. After examining the hairpiece and the woman to which it belonged, to the astonishment of her colleagues she identified this body as the missing remains of Queen Nefertiti. <br> <br> The search for Nefertiti had ended. She had been found. But the questions were just beginning. Nefertiti first rose to prominence in Egyptology in 1912, when a three-thousand-year-old bust of the queen was unearthed and quickly became a recognizable artifact around the world. But pieces of Nefertiti's life remained missing. The world had seen what she looked like, but few knew about her place in history. Virtually nothing is recorded about Nefertiti's early years. What is known about her life starts with her rise to power, her breaking through the sex barrier to rule as a virtual co-Pharaoh alongside her husband, Akhenaten. Upon his death she took full control of his kingdom. The Egyptian people loved her and celebrated her beauty in art, but the priests did not feel the same way. They believed Nefertiti's power over her husband was so great that she would instill her monotheistic beliefs upon him, rendering their own power obsolete. Egyptologists concur that it was these priests who, upon Nefertiti's death, had her name erased from public record and any likeness of her defaced. This ultimately led to her being left out of history for three thousand years.</p><p><p>Dr. Joann Fletcher is an honorary research and teaching fellow at the University of York, where she teaches Egyptian funerary archaeology and mummification. The author of numerous articles and books, she also lectures widely. She lives in Yorkshire, England.</p>Oftentimes, the best scholarship uses the investigation of one thing (such as a historical episode or a scientific anomaly) to speak to wider human and cultural truths. Fletcher&#x2019;s study of the life of the legendary queen Nefertiti is scholarship in just this sense. A learned and intensely personal book, it spans Fletcher&#x2019;s near-lifelong involvement with the study of Egyptian culture, from her first trip to Egypt as a teenager in 1981 to her most recent excavation in February 2003. Along the way, she provides the reader with a concise introduction to ancient Egyptian history as well as a rough guide to the shifting ideological landscape of professional Egyptology over the last 200 years. Colored by patriarchal assumptions and the personal ambitions of the men who first excavated the desert, Egyptology tends to focus on the most powerful men of ancient Egypt: kings ruling their country (and families) with unquestioned authority. This book is in part an attempt to correct such biases and challenge reigning assumptions about gender roles in ancient Egypt. Fletcher specializes in the study of "everyday" objects like hair, jewelry and clothing that are often passed over or discarded by Egyptologists. The sections of the book devoted to them offer compelling revelations about the identities of anonymous royal figures and the complex relations among and within dynasties. Ultimately, whether or not readers agree with the hypothesis Fletcher draws from her thrilling examination of the so-called Younger Woman (who she believes is Nefertiti) interred in tomb KV.35 in the Valley of Kings is irrelevant; this book is an inspiring record of a life devoted to the highest scholarship. 24 pages of color photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Just coming home from that guy&#x2019;s apartment, the guy you swore you were going to have &#x201c;the talk&#x201d; with two years ago? Watching Orange Is the New Black for the third consecutive Saturday night? Consistently looking at engagement rings on Pinterest even though you haven&#x2019;t had a steady boyfriend in a while? You&#x2019;ve come to the right place, Katherine Heigl. While most dating books are for newly divorced housewives with no marketable skills and girls who eat their feelings, this one is different. We&#x2019;re not going to give you step-by-step instructions on how to successfully date and marry the man of your dreams or even give you anecdotal evidence of that one girl who gained forty pounds and her boyfriend still loved her anyway. (The only way that won&#x2019;t matter is if he&#x2019;s also fat and/or works for her rich father and has an eye on the corner office.) We&#x2019;re here to tell you all those &#x201c;road maps to finding The One&#x201d; are bullshit, and the only way to master the art of not dying alone is realizing that dying alone is no big deal when you&#x2019;re going into the white light alongside the greatest person you know: You.<br> <br>Most dating books will make you feel like a hopeless nicegirl, her lifeless body destined to be found among her twenty-seven cats while Taylor Swift&#x2019;s &#x201c;oldies but goodies&#x201d; play on repeat. This book will betch slap you to reality, help you get your shit together, and remind you that the old Tay was lame as fuck.<br><br>Forgot What a Nicegirl Is?<br> <br>&#x201c;The nicegirl plays by the rules without ever questioning them. She&#x2019;s dull, lacks depth, allows people to walk all over her yet brings nothing to the table herself. If she disappeared, you wouldn&#x2019;t even notice. She&#x2019;s the girl who rarely colors outside the lines of her life, and even then only in baby pink. She&#x2019;s the kind of girl who uses a real bookmark. In other words, she&#x2019;s boring as fuck.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;The Betches<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, you&#x2019;re not born knowing how to date and you have a lot of shit to learn. Plus, we&#x2019;re not here to sugarcoat dating advice. Adding sugar to anything is going to seriously limit your dating prospects. So break out the Splenda, throw your cats out the window, and get in, loser; we&#x2019;re going to fix your fucked-up love life.<br> <br>But first, one of life&#x2019;s major questions (besides the most obvious: &#x201c;Is butter a carb?&#x201d;): Why even be in a relationship in the first place?<br><br>&#x201c;I think we can all agree that sleeping around is a great way to meet people.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;Chelsea Handler<br><br>The answer to this question seems to be obvious (duh, how else are you going to fulfill your dreams of having an envy-inducing wedding, popping out gorgeous kids with ironic first names, and packing cute little gluten- and dairy-free lunches?) but it turns out it&#x2019;s more complicated than it initially appears. Why even have a boyfriend? Unless you&#x2019;re like extremely religious&#x2014;in which case you&#x2019;re already offended by much of this book&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t need to date to have sex. You don&#x2019;t need to date to have kids (hello, in vitro). And you definitely don&#x2019;t have to date to be reminded how amazing and beautiful you are. That&#x2019;s what your grandma is for.<br> <br>Being in a relationship isn&#x2019;t always fun anyway. All of a sudden you have someone who wants to know where you are, what you&#x2019;re doing, and to whom you&#x2019;re sending Snapchats all the fucking time. It&#x2019;s like, why are you so obsessed with me? If you&#x2019;re with the right person, however, it can be super fun, and from a purely selfish standpoint at the very least you&#x2019;ll learn a lot about yourself with each new relationship you fuck up. You&#x2019;ll get to discover interesting new things about yourself like that you can be really bitchy when you&#x2019;re hungry and that you could never handle dating a guy with just a green Amex. He might as well pay with food stamps.<br> <br>But finding that person isn&#x2019;t easy . . . and if it is easy, then you&#x2019;re probably in that relationship for the wrong reasons. If you&#x2019;re lonely, get a friend. If you want attention, go on The Bachelor. If you want to have sex, walk outside.<br> <br>The only reason you should be in a relationship is because your boyfriend/fianc�/husband/lover adds something awesome to your life, not because he completes it. You&#x2019;re a betch, you have the privilege of your own company. You&#x2019;re a hot commodity and your time and, more important, your affection are valuable, so why would you let just anyone in? I mean, would Beyonc� date Kevin Federline? Exactly.<br><br>Dating Exercise<br> <br>Ask yourself: Is he the Jay Z to your Beyonc�?<br> <br>If no: Dump him<br> <br>If yes: Keep him<br> <br>If maybe: What kind of car does he drive?<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing worse than the girl who has never been single.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;The Betches<br><br>It&#x2019;s better to be alone than to be with someone who sucks. While having a boyfriend has its perks, so does being single. For instance, you can go out whenever you want. You can make out with whomever you want. And if it&#x2019;s been a long winter, you don&#x2019;t even have to shave your vag. Win, win, win.<br><br>&#x201c;Better alone than badly accompanied.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;Candace Bushnell, Sex and the City<br><br>One is not better than the other. It&#x2019;s about where you are in your life and what&#x2019;s best for you in the moment. If you think that a relationship is the key to your happiness you&#x2019;re as delusional as Karen.<br><br>Who the Fuck Is Karen?<br> <br>Karen is our extremely delusional friend. She doesn&#x2019;t live in reality. She constantly thinks guys are into her who are clearly not. She&#x2019;s terrible at reading signals, and her mom is the only person who believes that Karen has a boyfriend. Really, Karen&#x2019;s &#x201c;boyfriend&#x201d; is the guy she fucked three times who finally asked for her number. Don&#x2019;t be a Karen.<br> <br><br> <br> WHY SHOULD YOU LISTEN TO US?<p></p> <br>If you&#x2019;re a smart betch, you&#x2019;ve already read our first book and learned how to win at basically everything. You learned the pitfalls of being too nice, what friends are socially acceptable to chill with, and to never ever admit that you don&#x2019;t know shit about wine. But what about dating? Yes, we covered that, too, but a lot has changed. We&#x2019;ve grown up and the rules are different. Suddenly, it&#x2019;s sort of okay to online date, and the thought of being kind and caring to a guy is starting to not disgust you.<br> <br>The simple truth is that dating in college and dating when you&#x2019;re in the state of mind to fuck around is a very different ball game than dating in the real world. There comes a point in every young betch&#x2019;s life when she gets bored of her thrice-weekly clubbing excursions and shambling to work hungover every Thursday. She realizes that she might have to entertain the idea of settling down into a long-term relationship, if only because everything else seems boring as fuck and she&#x2019;s already been to Ibiza three times. If you haven&#x2019;t hit that point yet, you will eventually. Even Paris Hilton doesn&#x2019;t want to be known as &#x201c;that old bitch in the club&#x201d; forever. No one likes a washed-up party girl, so eventually you&#x2019;re going to need to learn how to master the art of a long-term, committed relationship.<br><br>&#x201c;Much of my high-jinks have been drug-related. When you&#x2019;re under 30, whatever, but once you&#x2019;re past 40 it&#x2019;s just ugly.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;Courtney Love<br><br>Unlike our grandparents, who actually needed to be married in order to leave their parents&#x2019; houses, the modern betch can have an entire fulfilling life alone and with her besties. We don&#x2019;t need to accept the first man who offers us a four-karat ring, because we have options. We can be anything we want to be. This often means we settle down later in the game.<br> <br>&#x201c;When are you getting married? Dating anyone lately? How&#x2019;s that boy you were talking to last year, you know, the one whose parents were lawyers? He was nice,&#x201d; your parents and grandparents might ask you to death. But don&#x2019;t listen to them. All your grandma is concerned about is being alive for your wedding and all your mom is doing is comparing you to her own situation. She was married by twenty-five, and your grandma has only ever slept with one man. They had different pressures then, and that&#x2019;s why they&#x2019;re applying the same pressure to you. Don&#x2019;t get mad at them, just be like Yah dating a few guys! Have a date tonight actually. Will let you know how it goes! Then hang up and resume your Thursday night binge of Scandal and weed.<br> <br>For our parents&#x2019; and grandparents&#x2019; generation, the name of the game was dependence. Getting out of the house, finding a husband to take care of you, popping out six kids. It was like passing the torch from your parents to your partner as the person who became responsible for you. But now it&#x2019;s all about independence for women . . . which is fucking amazing, but admittedly sometimes stressful because of that extreme pressure you may receive from your family who know nothing, Jon Snow.<br> <br>Okay, so I&#x2019;ll just like, settle down when I&#x2019;m bored and I feel like it, you think, stupidly. False. Most people suck at relationships and if you&#x2019;re a real betch, you&#x2019;re probably one of them. Our independent lifestyles full of Chanel bags, bottomless brunches, and yacht weeks are amazing, but they often leave us ill prepared for the world of real-life dating. Catch-22: It&#x2019;s precisely because we have so much fun on our own that dating can be so hard.<br> <br>A time comes in a betch&#x2019;s life when she&#x2019;s gone to her one-thousandth single-girls night out and sort of feels tired of it all. The long pregames, the cocaine hangovers, sex with the guy whom she would never actually date once she got to know him&#x2014;it becomes a drag. At this point she might say, Hey, I&#x2019;ve been single for enough time. I think I&#x2019;m ready to find the perfect boyfriend who I can marry someday! Oh yay I&#x2019;m excited. Thinking you can magically enter the perfect relationship as soon as you&#x2019;ve decided it&#x2019;s time is simply wrong. Most betches are quick to admit that they&#x2019;re bad at things like snowboarding or making their beds, but when it comes to relationships everyone is under the delusional impression that they can figure it out the first time they try. Do you think your spin instructor mastered her tap back the first time she stepped on the bike? No. Exactly.<br> <br>So how will this new adult relationship differ from your college routine of balancing three back-burner bros and a shady asshole bro more seamlessly than your homework assignments? Sadly, it&#x2019;s going to involve some actual effort on your part and some important realizations. Dating and sex after college when you&#x2019;re looking for somebody who has the potential for marriage involve actual self-reflection and sacrifice. Vom, we know, but like, it&#x2019;s true.<br> <br>We&#x2019;re here to teach you how to remain a powerful, confident, independent betch while finding love. We&#x2019;ll give you the secrets to staying hot and desired through every stage of your relationship, making sure your sex life doesn&#x2019;t go to shit, and giving you the keys to let go of the awful guys you&#x2019;ve entertained in the past to make room for the pro of your dreams. We&#x2019;ve mastered the art of dating with the help of asshole bros, extra-nice guys, awkward situations, and too many vodka sodas, and we think we&#x2019;re going to make it out alive.

You&#x2019;re welcome.<br> <br>While reading this book, remember the cardinal rule of betchdom: Don&#x2019;t take yourself or anyone around you that seriously. There are some real truth gems in here but read this book however the fuck you want. Don&#x2019;t be a trying-too-hard loser and highlight this shit or give it to your dud nicegirl friend to outline and summarize. Dating, much like this book, is supposed to be fun and light so have a laugh, bask in our awesomeness, and don&#x2019;t you dare pick up any other dating book but this one. No one wants to date the girl whose bookshelf is lined with The Rules and Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus.<br> <br>Sure you&#x2019;re going to fuck up our advice. A lot. We&#x2019;ve fucked it up, too. A lot. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re so smart. We&#x2019;ve been around the block and learned the hard way. And honestly, we&#x2019;re still learning. It&#x2019;s important to remember through all your shitty dates, vicious fights, and nasty breakups that at the end of the day, whoever locks you down is fucking incredibly lucky and all the shit you&#x2019;ve been through to find him will be worth it. There is no one out there like you and you are amazing, so even if you have days/weeks/months where you&#x2019;re feeling discouraged or lonely (gross) make like Dory from that movie where she has Alzheimer&#x2019;s and just keep swimming.<br><br>It&#x2019;s Me, the Head Pro. &#x2019;Sup?<br> <br>Hi there. If you&#x2019;ve looked to the Betches for dating advice prior to the year 0 BIHANTAOL (that&#x2019;s Before I Had a Nice Time and Other Lies, obviously), then we know each other. Not like, biblically, though I guess anything is possible. I mean that I&#x2019;m the Head Pro, the Betches&#x2019; resident guy expert for all what the fuck does this text even mean? issues, and chances are if you&#x2019;ve sought advice, your e-mail has come through my in-box. I give betches advice. Solicited advice, unlike that guy Corey in your hall freshman year, who&#x2014;news flash&#x2014;was just trying to fuck you.<br> <br>As you read this book, you&#x2019;ll see me pop in and out with my perspective on common dating shit. How soon is too soon to make a reservation for two (or more, if you like to party) at the Bone Zone Cafe? What are some dealbreakers that will cause your love interest to throw himself from the nearest tall building, resigning you to a life of loneliness and puppy Instagrams?<br> <br>We can do this, together, you and I.<br> <br> HAVING A BOYFRIEND FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING A BOYFRIEND<p></p> <br>Just don&#x2019;t do it. A lot of (sad) girls go to bed at night fantasizing how nice it would be to finally become the girlfriend of the guy she&#x2019;s been pining over since her sophomore year of college. But what these girls need to realize is that just because he is their crush, just because they lie there thinking oh my god he&#x2019;s so cute I&#x2019;m definitely in love, he is only that. A fucking crush. This guy is an illusion, a hologram of your perfect boyfriend with the face and body of the guy you think would look good with you in couples pics on Instagram. You&#x2019;re not in love. You definitely don&#x2019;t know this bro well enough to &#x201c;love him,&#x201d; and if you ever got together you would probably realize that he sucks.<br> <br>Dreaming about having a boyfriend is pathetic because it assumes that you need a guy to make you happy. By no means are we advocating that you should stay single forever. We just mean that a man should complement you, not complete you. Once you realize that you don&#x2019;t need a boyfriend to make your life amazing, only then might you actually find a boyfriend.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll come when you&#x2019;re not looking/least expect it,&#x201d; says everyone you ever spoke to about the hardships of being single whom you subsequently wanted to shoot in the eye. But the root of your anger for said people is because deep down you know it&#x2019;s true. Don&#x2019;t be thirsty for a boyfriend. Don&#x2019;t be the girl who wants to leave a perfectly fun pregame because you don&#x2019;t want to date any of the guys there. Don&#x2019;t be so transparently desperate.

George Guidall�s performance is spot-on, as usual, but it�s hard to imagine him keeping a straight face in the booth. First, there�s some atrocious dialogue between two violent thugs. It�s hard to take them seriously when they say �Hispanics� and refer to Rohypnol as �the date rape drug,� as opposed to a �roofie.� Other than the silly dialogue and shallow characters, the story is engaging as it recounts Laurie�s travails in solving a series of gruesome staff infection deaths.

There are irritating flies in the ointment, though, including a missing wife, a nagging cocaine habit, a dramatic deterioration in his genital health, a string of increasingly demanding extra-marital affairs. The last thing he needs is a messy murder to solve. Still it will mean plenty of overtime, a chance to stitch up some colleagues and finally clinch the promotion he craves. But as Bruce spirals through the lower reaches of degradation and evil, he encounters opposition - in the form of truth and ethical conscience - from the most unexpected quarter of all: his anus. In Bruce Robertson, Welsh has created one of the most corrupt, misanthropic characters in contemporary fiction , and has written a dark, disturbing and very funny novel about sleaze, power, and the abuse of everything. At last, a novel that lives up to its name. NOTE:The book is meant to have tapeworm effect as it&#39;s meant to reflect the tapeworm of his guts.</p><p>Irvine Welsh has produced more than his share of revolting characters in his short yet spectacular writing career, but in the creation of Detective Sergeant Bruce Robertson he has surpassed himself. The protagonist of <i>Filth</i> is, both personally and professionally, utterly corrupt; a thief, drug user, misogynist and racist, with standards of appearance and personal hygiene that are simply beyond belief. It goes without saying that his wife and children have left him but, oddly, he still has few drinking mates, and even some of the women he so hideously abuses are still prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. "The undeniable sexuality which is part and parcel of the complete dominance over another human being", opines the viciously selfish Robertson, is just part of what makes, "poliswork such a satisfying career." But, strangely, as we chart his inevitable decline...from what is admittedly a very low baseline--a solid, almost conventional, underlying morality begins to assert itself. Amid the degradation we come across a hint of reason as Welsh's stunningly direct dialogue and hideously imaginative plot combine in a thrilling, undeniably unsettling novel. --<i>Nick Wroe</i>"Welsh firing on all cylinders... The best thing he has done since<i> Trainspotting</i>" (<i>Sunday Times</i>)<br><br>"It is surely a remarkable cultural moment when a reviewer is offered cash in a bar for an advance copy of a literary novel... <i>Filth </i>is a masterpiece...squarely in the classic line of classic scottish writing" (<i>Independent</i>)<br><br>"Things are going well for Detective Sergeant Bruce Robertson. Promotion is in the offing, he's got all the booze and drugs he needs, and his various plots aimed at friends and colleagues seem to be working out. Robertson, compulsive and repulsive by turns, has only two problems. One is a case of racially-motivated murder on his patch. The other is that there's a nasty tapeworm in his gut and it seems intent on having its say... A brutally sustained achievement" (<i>Evening Standard</i>)<br><br>"We're used to tough cops with non-PC attitudes, but Welsh trumps the lot with his evil-scheming, ball-scratching, foul-mouthed hero-with-haemorrhoids... Welsh's jet-black comedy at once entertains and appals... Gloriously grotesque" (<i>Esquire</i>)<br><br>"A snarling epic of a book...ugly, devastatingly funny, unremittingly nasty and pulls no punches...

His most recent novel, <i>The Road</i>, received the Pulitzer Prize.I<br><br> I sent one boy to the gaschamber at Huntsville. One and only one. My arrest and my testimony. I went up there and visited with him two or three times. Three times. The last time was the day of his execution. I didnt have to go but I did. I sure didnt want to. He&#x2019;d killed a fourteen year old girl and I can tell you right now I never did have no great desire to visit with him let alone go to his execution but I done it. The papers said it was a crime of passion and he told me there wasnt no passion to it. He&#x2019;d been datin this girl, young as she was. He was nineteen. And he told me that he had been plannin to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him out he&#x2019;d do it again. Said he knew he was goin to hell. Told it to me out of his own mouth. I dont know what to make of that. I surely dont. I thought I&#x2019;d never seen a person like that and it got me to wonderin if maybe he was some new kind. I watched them strap him into the seat and shut the door. He might of looked a bit nervous about it but that was about all. I really believe that he knew he was goin to be in hell in fifteen minutes. I believe that. And I&#x2019;ve thought about that a lot. He was not hard to talk to. Called me Sheriff. But I didnt know what to say to him. What do you say to a man that by his own admission has no soul? Why would you say anything? I&#x2019;ve thought about it a good deal. But he wasnt nothin compared to what was comin down the pike.<br><br> They say the eyes are the windows to the soul. I dont know what them eyes was the windows to and I guess I&#x2019;d as soon not know. But there is another view of the world out there and other eyes to see it and that&#x2019;s where this is goin. It has done brought me to a place in my life I would not of thought I&#x2019;d of come to. Somewhere out there is a true and living prophet of destruction and I dont want to confront him. I know he&#x2019;s real. I have seen his work. I walked in front of those eyes once. I wont do it again. I wont push my chips forward and stand up and go out to meet him. It aint just bein older. I wish that it was. I cant say that it&#x2019;s even what you are willin to do. Because I always knew that you had to be willin to die to even do this job. That was always true. Not to sound glorious about it or nothin but you do. If you aint they&#x2019;ll know it. They&#x2019;ll see it in a heartbeat. I think it is more like what you are willin to become. And I think a man would have to put his soul at hazard. And I wont do that. I think now that maybe I never would.<br><br> The deputy left Chigurh standing in the corner of the office with his hands cuffed behind him while he sat in the swivelchair and took off his hat and put his feet up and called Lamar on the mobile.<br><br> Just walked in the door. Sheriff he had some sort of thing on him like one of them oxygen tanks for emphysema or whatever. Then he had a hose that run down the inside of his sleeve and went to one of them stunguns like they use at the slaughterhouse. Yessir. Well that&#x2019;s what it looks like. You can see it when you get in. Yessir. I got it covered. Yessir.<br><br> When he stood up out of the chair he swung the keys off his belt and opened the locked desk drawer to get the keys to the jail. He was slightly bent over when Chigurh squatted and scooted his manacled hands beneath him to the back of his knees. In the same motion he sat and rocked backward and passed the chain under his feet and then stood instantly and effortlessly. If it looked like a thing he&#x2019;d practiced many times it was. He dropped his cuffed hands over the deputy&#x2019;s head and leaped into the air and slammed both knees against the back of the deputy&#x2019;s neck and hauled back on the chain.<br><br> They went to the floor. The deputy was trying to get his hands inside the chain but he could not. Chigurh lay there pulling back on the bracelets with his knees between his arms and his face averted. The deputy was flailing wildly and he&#x2019;d begun to walk sideways over the floor in a circle, kicking over the wastebasket, kicking the chair across the room. He kicked shut the door and he wrapped the throwrug in a wad about them. He was gurgling and bleeding from the mouth. He was strangling on his own blood. Chigurh only hauled the harder. The nickelplated cuffs bit to the bone. The deputy&#x2019;s right carotid artery burst and a jet of blood shot across the room and hit the wall and ran down it. The deputy&#x2019;s legs slowed and then stopped. He lay jerking. Then he stopped moving altogether. Chigurh lay breathing quietly, holding him. When he got up he took the keys from the deputy&#x2019;s belt and released himself and put the deputy&#x2019;s revolver in the waistband of his trousers and went into the bathroom.<br><br> He ran cold water over his wrists until they stopped bleeding and he tore strips from a handtowel with his teeth and wrapped his wrists and went back into the office. He sat on the desk and fastened the toweling with tape from a dispenser, studying the dead man gaping up from the floor. When he was done he got the deputy&#x2019;s wallet out of his pocket and took the money and put it in the pocket of his shirt and dropped the wallet to the floor. Then he picked up his airtank and the stungun and walked out the door and got into the deputy&#x2019;s car and started the engine and backed around and pulled out and headed up the road.<br><br> On the interstate he picked out a late model Ford sedan with a single driver and turned on the lights and hit the siren briefly. The car pulled onto the shoulder. Chigurh pulled in behind him and shut off the engine and slung the tank across his shoulder and stepped out. The man was watching him in the rearview mirror as he walked up.<br><br> What&#x2019;s the problem, officer? he said.<br><br> Sir would you mind stepping out of the vehicle?<br><br> The man opened the door and stepped out. What&#x2019;s this about? he said.<br><br> Would you step away from the vehicle please.<br><br> The man stepped away from the vehicle. Chigurh could see the doubt come into his eyes at this bloodstained figure before him but it came too late. He placed his hand on the man&#x2019;s head like a faith healer. The pneumatic hiss and click of the plunger sounded like a door closing. The man slid soundlessly to the ground, a round hole in his forehead from which the blood bubbled and ran down into his eyes carrying with it his slowly uncoupling world visible to see. Chigurh wiped his hand with his handkerchief. I just didnt want you to get blood on the car, he said.<br><br> Moss sat with the heels of his boots dug into the volcanic gravel of the ridge and glassed the desert below him with a pair of twelve power german binoculars. His hat pushed back on his head. Elbows propped on his knees. The rifle strapped over his shoulder with a harnessleather sling was a heavybarreled .270 on a &#x2019;98 Mauser action with a laminated stock of maple and walnut. It carried a Unertl telescopic sight of the same power as the binoculars. The antelope were a little under a mile away. The sun was up less than an hour and the shadow of the ridge and the datilla and the rocks fell far out across the floodplain below him. Somewhere out there was the shadow of Moss himself. He lowered the binoculars and sat studying the land. Far to the south the raw mountains of Mexico. The breaks of the river. To the west the baked terracotta terrain of the run- ning borderlands. He spat dryly and wiped his mouth on the shoulder of his cotton workshirt.<br><br> The rifle would shoot half minute of angle groups. Five inch groups at one thousand yards. The spot he&#x2019;d picked to shoot from lay just below a long talus of lava scree and it would put him well within that distance. Except that it would take the better part of an hour to get there and the antelope were grazing away from him. The best he could say about any of it was that there was no wind.<br><br> When he got to the foot of the talus he raised himself slowly and looked for the antelope. They&#x2019;d not moved far from where he last saw them but the shot was still a good seven hundred yards. He studied the animals through the binoculars. In the compressed air motes and heat distortion. A low haze of shimmering dust and pollen. There was no other cover and there wasnt going to be any other shot.<br><br> He wallowed down in the scree and pulled off one boot and laid it over the rocks and lowered the forearm of the rifle down into the leather and pushed off the safety with his thumb and sighted through the scope.<br><br> They stood with their heads up, all of them, looking at him.<br><br> Damn, he whispered. The sun was behind him so they couldnt very well have seen light reflect off the glass of the scope. They had just flat seen him.<br><br> The rifle had a Canjar trigger set to nine ounces and he pulled the rifle and the boot toward him with great care and sighted again and jacked the crosshairs slightly up the back of the animal standing most broadly to him. He knew the exact drop of the bullet in hundred yard increments. It was the distance that was uncertain. He laid his finger in the curve of the trigger. The boar&#x2019;s tooth he wore on a gold chain spooled onto the rocks inside his elbow.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Golf Club: 400 Years of The Good, The Beautiful, and The Creative</h2><p>THE GOLF CLUB presents over 450 of the most magnificent, historical, and valuable golf clubs ever devised to strike a golf ball during the past 400 years. <p>Inside are rare treasures made by Scotland's Old Tom Morris, known as "The Grand Old Man of Golf," and Hugh Philp, often called the Stradivarious of clubmakers. You will also find modern masterpieces by Ping, Spalding, Callaway, MacGregor, Titleist, Nike and others. You may even find a club that you own! </p><p>You will see the club that Alan Shephard used on the moon, the 1-iron made famous by Ben Hogan when he won the 1950 US Open, the putter used by Willie Park to win the British Open in 1863, the Calamity Jane putter Bobby Jones used to win the Grand Slam in 1930, and the putter Jack Nicklaus used to win 15 of his 20 majors. </p><p>Recent Sales prices are given for a number of the clubs shown, and the clubs are accompanied by photographs of over 60 vintage golf balls from across history</p></p><p>Jeff Ellis is the foremost authority on antique golf clubs in the world. He has appraised many antique golf collections, including those of the Royal Canadian Golf Association and the Los Angeles Country Club. In 1998 he brokered a single antique golf collection with a sale price in excess of $4 million. <p>In 1997 Ellis's first book, "The Clubmaker's Art" was published. It took 10 years to complete and received widespread critical acclaim. It was named Golf Book of the Year in 1998 by THE GOLFER magazine. In 1999, GOLF WORLD magazine named "The Clubmaker's Art" to its list of "Top Ten Golf Books of The 20th Century." In Great Britain, Ellis was awarded "The Murdoch Medal" for outstanding achievement in the worold of golf literature. </p><p>His New book, "The Golf Club: 400 Years of The Good, The Beautiful &amp; The Creative," builds on the foundation established by "The Clubmakers Art." It takes the reader on a fascinating journey that begins with clubs made as far back as the 1600s and culminates with clubs made as recently as 2002. Readers will marvel at the ingenuity and craftsmanship of the clubs awaiting them on these pages</p>Good craftsmen never blame their tools. Yet here we have 400 years of golfers searching for better tools. The evolution of golf's "tools" is a tribute to the maddeningly subtle difficulties of a game that motivates players to search endlessly for the putter to alleviate yips, the driver to straighten out a chronic shank, and a sand wedge to compensate for the damn driver that dumped them in the trap in the first place. Ellis is an accomplished amateur golfer who also wrote the highly acclaimed <i>The Clubmaker's Art</i> (1997). The format here is deceptively simple: Ellis provides a brief overview of an era and the trend clubmaking took within it. He follows with beautiful color photographs of dozens of clubs, with brief comments on each, including designer and manufacturer. The information is fascinating, and the photography is beautiful, but what will draw golfers to the book is the connection it will provide to kindred souls of centuries past, who are passionate about a sport in which one's only competition comes from within. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Moral and religious perspective has been replaced by medical and therapeutic rhetoric. It is little wonder why the world is plagued by legions of rapists, drug users, murderers, thieves, and child abusers, all of whom are now referred to as having one form or another of ''addiction'' and are thus either ''sick'' or suffering from ''mental illness.'' Accordingly, modern psychotherapists claim that these are in need of specialized ''therapy'' or ''treatment'' to help them ''cope with their disease.'' Moral relativism, bolstered by psychotherapy, has prevailed over the traditional ideas of self-control, individual responsibility, and moral culpability.

These works reveal their meaning most clearly when we do not relegate them to the function of illustrating a text or see them merely as specimens of the applied arts, but take them seriously as unique combinations of historical witness and aesthetic object. Drawn from Russia, Central and Western Europe, and the United States, from the turn of the century to the aftermath of the Second World War, the posters form a bridge between the claims of ideology and the state on the one hand and the support or submission of millions of men and women on the other. How can men be persuaded to fight for their party or country, and how can women be convinced to enter the workforce in wartime and retreat to the home when their men return? How can women be brought to believe that losing their husbands and sons is a noble sacrifice? Where can money be found to pay for the costs of the war and of reconstruction? Are guilt, compassion, and fear sufficient to bind the homefront to the fighting men? What is the most effective way to dehumanize the enemy, whether foreign or domestic? These are some of the issues that the posters in this volume lay bare and begin to explain. Together text and image open fresh perspectives on half a century of war, revolution, and renewed war, and point toward a new kind of integrative history. Except for seven posters, the images in this book are from the archives of the Hoover Institution on War, Peace and Revolution at Stanford University. Soon after the outbreak of the First World War, Herbert Hoover began to collect documents, including posters, from the warring powers. He laid the foundation for one of the world's great poster collections, now consisting of some 75,000 posters as well as of nearly 40,000 proclamations and other purely typographical announcements.</p></p><p>Reproducing 317 posters in the Hoover Institution's collection from the Soviet Union, western and central Europe and the United States, this punchy survey focuses on the two world wars, but also traces events and styles from the Belle Epoque to postwar Europe. Among the book's interesting revelations: during WW I, American and British posters used images of atrocity far more frequently than did German posters, while Russia and Germany were the principal exploiters of atrocity propaganda in WW II. American visual responses to the Second World War ranged from Ben Shahn's sophisticated attack on Nazi brutality to crude, racist caricatures of Japanese. Post-1945 posters include graphics protesting Stalinist repression, nuclear arms, German remilitatization and U.S. intervention in Vietnam. In their thoughtful narrative, Peter Paret (a Princeton historian), Lewis (an art historian at the College of Wooster in Ohio) and Paul Paret (a graduate student in art history) consider posters both as works of applied art and as agents of persuasion and control. History Book Club selection. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.This handsome, powerful, and disturbing book collects 317 examples from the Hoover Institution's choice collection of war propaganda posters, primarily from the period 1915-45. Posters from major combatants are presented in their historical context, giving vivid reminders of the poster's power to persuade and inflame (among the images shown are a ratlike creature caught in a "Jap trap" and the "eternal Jew" depicted as a usurer). The book is better focused than similar efforts, such as Walton Rawls's Wake Up America!: World War I and the American Poster ( LJ 1/89). Unfortunately, coverage since 1945 is much too brief, scarcely acknowledging the poster's role in Vietnam War protests or the recent democratic revolutions. However, this book will have permanent value in any political history collection.<br><i>- Stephen Rees, Bucks Cty.

Grade 7 Up&#x2013;At 15, Thomas Peaceful, like many other English soldiers in World War I, is too young to fight, but he lies about his age. Now at the front in France with his older brother Charlie he stands a lonely nighttime vigil for reasons that are not explained until the book's end, watching the minutes tick by and reflecting on his past. Using first-person narration, Morpurgo draws readers into this young man's life, relating memories that are idyllic, sobering, and poignant. Tommo thinks upon the role he played in his father's accidental death, the adventures that he shared with Charlie, his relationship with his childhood friend Molly, and the experiences that he has had since entering the war. Finally, he describes how Charlie disobeyed a direct order to stay with him after he was wounded in action, fully aware of this decision's dire consequences. While this story is not based on any one individual, Morpurgo has personalized the British tactic of executing their own soldiers "for cowardice or desertion," memorializing these men without passing judgment. While readers see the events through Tommo's eyes, the author does not lose sight of the war's effects on the teen's friends and family. Reminders come in the form of letters from home, relationships with other soldiers, and observations of battles. This thoughtful novel touches on themes of humanity and duty, and features brilliant characters whose personal decisions have earned them their very own badges of honor.<i>&#x2013;Delia Fritz, Mercersburg Academy, PA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Nearing seventy, Sister now must select a joint master to ensure the club's future. It is an honor of the highest order--and one that any serious social climber would covet like the Holy Grail.<br><br>When the competition flares up between two determined candidates, Southern gentility flies out the window. Soon the entire town is pulled into a rivalry that is spiraling dangerously out of control. Even the animals have strong opinions. But when opening hunt day ends in murder, Sister is stunned. Now, with the help of a few clever foxes and hounds, she must lay the trap to catch the killer.</p><p>Rita Mae Brown fervently believes that felines are a lot smarter than most people, and in her popular Mrs. Murphy mysteries, the cats are always leaps and bounds ahead of their human companions. (They also speak in italics, which makes it easy to distinguish them from their somewhat bumbling owner/companions.) In <i>Outfoxed</i> the foxes, hounds, and a few clever birds solve a murder that's hardly more than a raison d'�tre for Brown's thorough and detailed description of the highly ritualized world of the Jefferson Hunt. Fox hunting is more than just an entertaining way to spend a fall afternoon in Virginia--it's a way of life for everyone involved, from Sister Jane, the Master of the Fox Hunt, to Crawford Howard and Fontaine Buruss, two men who'd kill for the chance to succeed her. By the time a death actually occurs, Brown is three-fourths of the way to the last page, but it doesn't really matter; by this point, the reader is wholly involved in the arcane world of casts, whippers, scent stations, ratshots, and the social rules of the canid and canine communities. And while a man has been murdered, it's the slaughter of the fox used to lure him to his death that really upsets Sister, the strong-willed matriarch who is the novel's protagonist. The thrill of the chase--the hunt itself, not the search for the killer--is on every page of this masterful foray into a fascinating world. And as usual in a Rita Mae Brown novel, the animals have the best lines as well as the last word. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Rita Mae Brown is the bestselling author of Rubyfruit Jungle, In Her Day, Six of One, Southern Discomfort, Sudden Death, High Hearts, Bingo, Starting from Scratch: A Different Kind of Writer&#39;s Manual, Venus Envy, Dolley: A Novel of Dolley Madison in Love and War, Riding Shotgun, Loose Lips, and a memoir, Rita Will.

Calling the mission a once-in-a-lifetime fighter pilot&#39;s dream when he spotted a large mass of enemy planes bearing down on the U.S. ships, one navy pilot from Indiana, Alex Vraciu, flying a Hellcat fighter from the USS Lexington, pounced on the Japanese and shot down six dive bombers in just eight minutes. Written by award-winning biographer Ray E. Boomhower, Fighter Pilot: The World War II Career of Alex Vraciu, the sixth volume in the Indiana Historical Society Press&#39;s youth biography series, examines the daring exploits of the Hoosier flier during his wartime career. A graduate of DePauw University, Vraciu learned to fly during his college years through a government program and joined the navy before America was thrust into the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Possessed with keen eyesight, quick reflexes, excellent shooting instincts, and a knack for finding his opponent&#39;s weak spot, Vraciu became skilled in the deadly game of destroying the enemy in the skies over the Pacific Ocean. For a period of four months in 1944, Vraciu stood as the leading ace in the U.S. Navy. He shot down nineteen enemy airplanes in the air, destroyed an additional twenty-one on the ground, and sank a large Japanese merchant ship with a well-placed bomb hit. Vraciu&#39;s luck, however, finally ran out on December 14, 1944, during a strafing run against a Japanese airfield before the American invasion to retake the Philippines. Luckily he was almost immediately rushed to safety by a small group of U.S. Army in the Far East guerrillas, who had been battling the Japanese in the area for the past few years. The navy pilot spent the next five weeks with the guerrillas, receiving the honorary rank of brevet major while with them. Vraci finally marched into an American camp carrying with him a captured Japanese Luger pistol and sword.</p><p>This youth biography examines the daring exploits of the Hoosier flying ace during his war time service.

Douglas MacArthur has hired private eye Toby Peters to recover some incriminating papers that might keep the general from going into public life after the war. The papers, and funds that could help MacArthur finance a campaign, have been stolen by a civilian aide, Andrew Lansing. Meanwhile, Peters is offered the services of another detective, former Pinkerton op Dashiell Hammett, who's hiding out from Lillian Hellman while trying to recover his health so he can enlist in the army. The chase leads the two to Angel Springs, Calif., and to the mysterious and eccentric millionaire, Mr. Pintacki, who has his own ideas about keeping America great, which don't include a general as president. After Peters discovers Lansing's body on Pintacki's property, the crazed tycoon and his goons pursue Hammett and Peters; the latter, at the same time, tries to make time with his former wife and runs afoul of his uptight cop brother Phil. This 13th entry in Kaminsky's ( The Man Who Shot Lewis Vance ) immensely popular series about Peters tries too hard and spreads itself too thin: the background and the effort to establish it are just a little too obvious. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Shanghai Modern: The Flowering of a New Urban Culture in China, 1930&#x2013;1945 (Interpretations of Asia)</h2><p><p>In the midst of China's wild rush to modernize, a surprising note of reality arises: Shanghai, it seems, was once modern indeed, a pulsing center of commerce and art in the heart of the twentieth century.

He shows us the architecture and urban spaces in which the new commercial culture flourished, then guides us through the publishing and filmmaking industries that nurtured a whole generation of artists and established a bold new style in urban life known as <i>modeng</i>. In the work of six writers of the time, particularly Shi Zhecun, Mu Shiying, and Eileen Chang, Lee discloses the reflection of Shanghai's urban landscape--foreign and familiar, oppressive and seductive, traditional and innovative. This work acquires a broader historical and cosmopolitan context with a look at the cultural links between Shanghai and Hong Kong, a virtual genealogy of Chinese modernity from the 1930s to the present day.</p></p><p>THIS BOOK IMMERSES US in the golden age of Shanghai urban culture, a modernity at once intrinsically Chinese and profoundly anomalous, blending new and indigenous ideas with those flooding into this &#34;treaty port&#34; from the Western world.

He shows us the architecture and urban spaces in which the new commercial culture flourished, then guides us through the publishing and filmmaking industries that nurtured a whole generation of artists and established a bold new style in urban life. In the work of six writers of the time, particularly Shi Zhecun, Mu Shiying, and Eileen Chang, Lee discloses the reflection of Shanghai&#39;s urban landscape -- foreign and familiar, oppressive and seductive, traditional and innovative.Leo Ou-fan Lee is Professor Emeritus of Chinese Literature at Harvard University and Professor of Humanities at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p><h2>Moroccan Interiors</h2><p>Exploring contemporary interiors in the sun-soaked African nation of Morocco, this breathtaking volume takes readers into the restored palaces in the medinas of Marrakesh as well as humble fishermen&#39;s homes at Sisi Moussa d&#39;Aglou.

This long-awaited, monumental work covers the Cactaceae in an encyclopedic manner, addressing 125 genera and 1810 species. The most comprehensive single resource on the subject available today, it includes more than 1000 color photographs in addition to other illustrations. The introduction to each genus concentrates on the discovery of the cacti, and the improvements in our understanding of them, many of which result from relatively recent investigation. As stated in the foreword, &#34;Cacti have a special fascination all their own. Miniature spiny dwarf cacti less than an inch in diameter are hidden in the arid regions of North and South America; the majestic columns of the giant saguaro, Carnegiea gigantea, dominate the deserts of Arizona. Yet all these cacti, given time, offer the surprising paradox of brilliant flowers, their delicacy a striking contrast to the strong spines that keep the viewer at a respectful distance.&#34; This remarkable diversity is fully described and illustrated in this authoritative encyclopedia, which is both scientifically accurate and readable. It also includes a chapter by Roger Brown on the cultivation of cacti, making the book even more useful to growers and hobbyists, as well as to taxonomists, ethnobotanists, and conservationists---indeed, anyone interested in succulent plants.</p><p>The most comprehensive single resource on the subject available today, this monumental work includes more than 1000 color photographs in addition to other illustrations.

Because palms are often underutilized as a result of their unfamiliarity --- even to tropical gardeners --- Robert Lee Riffle and Paul Craft have exhaustively documented every genus in the palm family. Approximately 890 species are described in detail, including cold hardiness, water needs, height, and any special requirements. Generously illustrated with more than 900 photos, this volume is as valuable as an identification guide as it is a practical handbook. It even contains photos of several palm species that have never before appeared in a general encyclopedia. Interesting snippets of history, ethnobotany, and biology inform the text and make this a lively catalog of these remarkable plants.</p><p>This is a definitive account of palms that may be grown in the garden and landscape.

Big trucks often go through Midnight, slowing to stop for (or speeding up to beat) the traffic light at the intersection of the Davy highway and Witch Light Road. Since Manfred&#x2019;s rented house lies on Witch Light Road, he&#x2019;s grown used to the sound until it is simply background music. But the absence of that sound pierces his preoccupation. He&#x2019;s on his feet and opening the front door before he&#x2019;s aware of pushing back from his desk. He grabs a jacket from the rack by the door.</p><p>Glancing across the road, he sees his friend Fiji Cavanaugh come out into her front garden, which is at its bleakest in January. It&#x2019;s cold today, by Texas standards, but sunny. Her cat, Mr. Snuggly, a golden tabby, is at his current favorite sunning spot, the base of the pot where Fiji plans to try a gardenia. Even Mr. Snuggly is staring west.</p><p>Manfred exchanges a nod with Fiji, who is bundled in a quilted coat. He notes that today she has inexplicably arranged her hair in two dog-ears, like a six-year-old. Then he turns his attention back to the trucks. One is an equipment truck, and it&#x2019;s laden with building supplies: boards, bricks, electrician&#x2019;s wire, plumbing pipes, hardware. Two battered white vans have disgorged a clown-car number of small brown men, wearing hoodies they will surely discard as the day warms. Emerging from a Lexus, clearly in charge, is a tall white woman in tan slacks and a blue silk T-shirt. She&#x2019;s wearing a faux-fur vest. Her thick brown hair is gathered back into a sleek ponytail, and she wears silver earrings and a silver necklace. She also wears glasses, with big square tortoiseshell frames, and her lipstick is an aggressive red.</p><p>All these various vehicles, with their assortment of passengers, have converged around the defunct R�o Roca Fr�a Hotel at the southwest corner of the intersection. As far as Manfred knows, it has been closed for decades. The work crews immediately start pulling the boards off the doors and windows and tossing the ancient plywood into a large skip that yet another truck has deposited on the cracked sidewalk. The workmen swarm into the dark interior of the hotel.</p><p>It reminds Manfred of a giant boot kicking a dormant anthill.</p><p>Within five minutes, Fiji has crossed the road to join him. Simultaneously, Bobo Winthrop saunters down the steps of his business and residence, Midnight Pawn, which is situated at the same intersection as the R�o Roca Fr�a Hotel but catty-cornered to it. Manfred sees (with resignation) that Bobo is looking quietly handsome today, though he&#x2019;s wearing faded jeans and an ancient T-shirt with an equally ancient flannel shirt open over it. Manfred and Fiji stand with Bobo, and as they do, Manfred sees that west of the intersection, Teacher Reed has come out of Gas N Go; it&#x2019;s directly across the highway from the pawnshop on the east and the hotel on the south. His statuesque wife, Madonna, is standing on the sidewalk in front of the Home Cookin Restaurant with Grady, the baby, who&#x2019;s wrapped in a blanket. She&#x2019;s holding Grady with one arm, shading her eyes with the other. Across the street from Madonna, Joe Strong and Chuy Villegas have stepped out of the Antique Gallery and Nail Salon. Joe is like his name: muscular. He looks as though he may be forty. Chuy is shorter, his dark hair is thinning a bit, and his skin is the color of toast.</p><p>Even the Rev, in his rusty black suit, emerges from his white-painted chapel to cast an unreadable look at all the activity.</p><p><i>We&#x2019;re only missing Olivia and Lemuel,</i> Manfred thinks. Of course, Lemuel cannot come out during the day, and Olivia is gone on one of her mysterious business trips.</p><p>After a few more minutes of watching and wondering, Joe Strong takes the initiative and strolls across Witch Light Road. He threads his way through the busy men to Boss Woman, who appears to be looking over some plans on a clipboard&#x2014;though Manfred is sure, reading the clues in her stance, that she is well aware of Joe&#x2019;s approach.</p><p>Boss Woman turns to face Joe and extends her free hand to shake his, a professional smile pasted on her face. She is able to look Joe directly in the eyes, Manfred observes. She seems to like what she sees. The well-groomed Joe is pleasant looking and has a warm manner. His mouth moves; her mouth moves. They grin at each other without sincerity. Manfred thinks, <i>It&#x2019;s like watching a ritual</i>. In his peripheral vision, he spies the Rev retreating into his chapel, but the rest of the Midnighters stay outside.</p><p>Bobo turns to Manfred. &#x201c;Had you heard anything about this?&#x201d; he asks.</p><p>&#x201c;No. Believe me, I would have spread the word,&#x201d; Manfred tells his landlord. &#x201c;This is a big thing, right?&#x201d; He is aware that he feels ridiculously excited by this development in the small town where he&#x2019;s lived for less than a year. <i>Rein it in,</i> he advises himself. <i>It&#x2019;s not like the circus has come to town.</i></p><p>And yet, in a way, it&#x2019;s exactly like that. Fiji&#x2019;s round, pretty face reflects his curiosity. Her eyes are lit up.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; she says, bouncing up and down on the balls of her feet. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to reopen the hotel, huh? How can they even get it back up to code? It&#x2019;s been closed so many years. Everything will need to be ripped out and replaced. Plumbing, electricity&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. floors&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Bobo nods. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been in there. Right after I moved here, Lem and I went in one night. There was a loose board at the back, and Lem pried it open. We had flashlights. He just wanted to show it to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What was it like?&#x201d; Manfred asks.</p><p>&#x201c;Spooky as hell. The old reception desk with all the pigeonholes for mail is still there. The light fixtures were just hanging down with all these cobwebs on &#x2019;em. Like a horror movie. High ceilings. Wallpaper coming off in shreds. Smelled like mice. We didn&#x2019;t even go to the second floor. The stairs were a death trap.&#x201d; He smiles. &#x201c;Lem remembered it when it was open. He said it was pretty nice then.&#x201d;</p><p>Lemuel is well over a century and a half old, so it is not surprising that he can remember the hotel in its heyday.</p><p>&#x201c;So why would anyone spend the money to renovate it?&#x201d; Manfred says out loud, since that is the question on all their minds. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t it be cheaper to build a Motel 6 if you felt like Midnight could support a hotel?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who wants to spend the night <i>here</i>?&#x201d; Fiji asks, another question they&#x2019;ve all thought about. &#x201c;There are three motels in Davy if you go north, and at least six over in Marthasville if you go west. If you go to the interstate, there are a skadillion places to stay. Besides, Home Cookin isn&#x2019;t open for breakfast.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s the only restaurant within fifteen miles.</p><p>They contemplate all those facts in silence.</p><p>&#x201c;How many rooms in that hotel?&#x201d; Manfred asks Bobo.</p><p>Bobo looks down at him, blue eyes narrowed in thought. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t think more than twelve,&#x201d; he concludes. &#x201c;The ground floor is the lobby and the kitchen and the dining room, plus there was an ancient phone booth, don&#x2019;t know when that went in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there weren&#x2019;t bathrooms in the rooms&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so, say four guest rooms on the ground floor plus a bathroom and the public rooms, and then eight on the second floor plus two bathrooms? And the third floor was storage and staff rooms, Lem said.&#x201d;</p><p>Fiji grabs Bobo&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;You said dining room?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Bobo says, surprised by her agitation. &#x201c;Oh. I get it. The Reeds.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how Home Cookin keeps open, anyway. Really. Think about it. How?&#x201d; Manfred spreads his open hands as he asks them.</p><p>But Bobo and Fiji ignore Manfred&#x2019;s question. They are just glad to have a good cook like Madonna in Midnight.</p><p>&#x201c;If they <i>don&#x2019;t</i> open the dining room&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Bobo says.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be a good thing.&#x201d; Fiji ends his thought. &#x201c;Home Cookin will be busy, Gas N Go will be busy, and maybe even Joe and Chuy will sell more antiques and do more nails.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Huh,&#x201d; Manfred says. &#x201c;That would be all right.&#x201d; Though he really feels he doesn&#x2019;t want anything to change in Midnight, he makes himself admit that a touch of prosperity would be good for the town. His own business is done by telephone and Internet and does not depend on foot traffic.</p><p>Manfred&#x2019;s cell phone rings, and he whips it out of his pocket. He doesn&#x2019;t have to look at the caller ID to know it&#x2019;s Joe, whom he&#x2019;s watched walking back to Chuy.</p><p>&#x201c;We need to have a meeting tonight,&#x201d; Joe says without preamble. &#x201c;Maybe Fiji can go ask the Rev, and Bobo can tell Lemuel. Is Olivia in town?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. What time?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Here at the shop, whenever it&#x2019;s really dark.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s a muffled sound while Joe asks Chuy a question. &#x201c;Seven o&#x2019;clock good?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine, I&#x2019;ll tell them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;See you then.&#x201d;</p><p>Manfred ends the conversation and passes along the message.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell the Rev, but you can&#x2019;t ever predict what he&#x2019;ll do,&#x201d; Fiji says with a shrug.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put a note downstairs for Lemuel,&#x201d; Bobo says. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll see it the minute he gets up. Maybe Olivia will be back by then.&#x201d;</p><p>That night, when the work crews have gone and the tall woman, too, the inhabitants of Midnight assemble in the Antique Gallery and Nail Salon. Occasionally, they can hear Rasta yapping upstairs in the very nice apartment Joe and Chuy share. &#x201c;I thought he might wake up Grady,&#x201d; Chuy explains. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll calm down in a second.&#x201d;</p><p>Sure enough, Rasta falls silent after everyone has filtered in. The salon area is the front right corner of the store, and the antiques, dusted and arranged attractively, take up the rest. Joe has assembled some folding chairs and an old love seat around a refreshments table. He and Chuy have made lemonade and tea, and there are a couple of bottles of wine. They&#x2019;ve put out a cheese and cracker tray. Fiji has brought a bowl of toasted, salted pecans. Manfred tries one to be polite, then finds it hard to resist grabbing a handful.</p><p>When they all have drinks and food, they choose seats.</p><p>Madonna and Teacher settle on the love seat, with baby Grady drowsing on Madonna&#x2019;s chest. Madonna is regal and a little scary, and she&#x2019;s never been especially friendly. Her husband, Teacher, who is running Gas N Go until another buyer is in place, is the town handyman. Teacher is good at everything. Since he&#x2019;s been working at the convenience store full-time, projects are going undone in the town, and everyone is ready for a return to the status quo, including Teacher. Grady has started pulling up and will begin walking, and Madonna&#x2019;s already worried about cooking at the restaurant with him staggering around.</p><p>Joe stands in front of the motley assortment of chairs on which they&#x2019;ve perched and begins, &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s what I know.&#x201d;</p><p>They all fall silent and look attentive.</p><p>&#x201c;The woman in charge is Eva Culhane. She&#x2019;s not the owner. She&#x2019;s his or her agent. I don&#x2019;t know who the real owner is, she was real closemouthed about that. Here&#x2019;s what she told me. The hotel is going to reopen as a hotel. But the eight small rooms on the bottom floor will be made into four suites with their own bathrooms, and four rooms on the upper floor will get the same treatment. These will be residence rooms.&#x201d;</p><p>There is an intake of breath because so many people have questions.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; Joe says. &#x201c;Wait!&#x201d;</p><p>There&#x2019;s a little laughter, but they are all too curious or anxious to be very amused.</p><p>&#x201c;The residence rooms will be for people who are in the area for a long-term job, like working for three months at Magic Portal. Or people who are waiting to get into an eldercare situation. As an aside, Eva Culhane told me that there&#x2019;s a waiting list for all the eldercare places in a sixty-mile radius. The remaining rooms will be conventional hotel rooms. In the family quarters, there&#x2019;ll be two people living there as staff. A cook will provide breakfast for residents and whoever stays at the hotel. Lunch and dinner will be cooked for permanent residents only, is what I got out of it.&#x201d;</p><p>Madonna&#x2019;s shoulders relax visibly. She gets a few diners from Magic Portal, which is an Internet company, every month. (Thanks to Magic Portal, Midnight has great Internet.) And ranchers come into Midnight every now and then for a meal. But she&#x2019;s in the room with her regulars, right now. More customers would be welcome. Elderly people like traditional food, which is what Madonna cooks.</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of staff?&#x201d; Fiji asks.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be two people in residence,&#x201d; Joe repeats.</p><p>&#x201c;Will one of them be a nurse or some kind of medical person?&#x201d; Bobo asks. &#x201c;Sounds like they might need that. And they&#x2019;ll have to hire a maid, I would think. That&#x2019;s a lot of rooms to clean for one person, plus dishes, plus food prep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good questions. We&#x2019;ll have to find out.&#x201d; Joe looks a little chagrined he didn&#x2019;t think of all this.</p><p>&#x201c;Did Ms. Culhane give you a timetable?&#x201d; Fiji asks.</p><p>&#x201c;She said they hope to be open within six months.&#x201d;</p><p>There&#x2019;s a moment of silence.</p><p>&#x201c;They must have a shitload of money,&#x201d; Teacher Reed says, and Bobo nods. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a quick turnaround.&#x201d;</p><p>Olivia, who&#x2019;d driven in an hour earlier, speaks for the first time. She is sitting with Lemuel the vampire, her lover, and she looks exhausted. They are all ignoring the fact that Olivia&#x2019;s shoulder is obviously bandaged under her shirt. &#x201c;We have to find out who owns the company doing the restoration,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>&#x201c;Manfred, can you dig that up?&#x201d; Joe asks.</p><p>Manfred is the most computer savvy of all the Midnight residents, but he&#x2019;s no hacker. He just knows his way around the Internet. &#x201c;I can try,&#x201d; he says. Joe hands him a brochure, one that Eva Culhane had given him. It has a corporation name on it, MultiTier Living. Olivia extends her hand silently, and Manfred hands it to her. She looks at the brochure intently before she hands it back.</p><p>When everyone has said everything they have to say (some more than once), Lemuel supports Olivia with his arm as they leave Joe and Chuy&#x2019;s store/salon. The remaining Midnight residents go their separate ways: Teacher, Madonna, and the sleeping Grady cross the street to walk past Home Cookin Restaurant and behind it to their double-wide, the Rev splitting off from them to go right to his bleak little cottage. He has not spoken during the whole meeting, but he has eaten cheese and crackers and the toasted pecans.</p><p>The people who live east of the Davy highway (Bobo, Manfred, Fiji) walk together, Fiji carrying a plastic container with the remaining pecans. Fiji hands the container to Bobo. &#x201c;You and Manfred split those,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got some more at home.&#x201d; She looks both ways before she crosses Witch Light Road. The golden tabby cat, Mr. Snuggly, is waiting for her, and Bobo and Manfred watch the woman and the cat go in the front door. Bobo says, &#x201c;Hold out your hands.&#x201d; Manfred pulls a real cloth handkerchief from his pocket and holds it ready to catch half the salted pecans. Gathering up the corners, he nods his thanks, and Bobo splits away to go into the side door of the pawnshop, which leads to the stairs going up to his apartment.</p><p>Manfred unlocks the front door of his little house, which he rents from Bobo.

It was also home to Huo Sang and Bao Lang, fictional Chinese counterparts to Arthur Conan Doyle&#x2019;s Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. The duo lived in a spacious apartment on Aiwen Road, where Huo Sang played the violin (badly) and smoked Golden Dragon cigarettes as he mulled over his cases. Cheng Xiaoqing (1893&#x2013;1976), "The Grand Master" of twentieth-century Chinese detective fiction, had first encountered Conan Doyle&#x2019;s highly popular stories as an adolescent. In the ensuing years he played a major role in rendering them first into classical and later into vernacular Chinese. In the late 1910s, Cheng began writing detective fiction very much in Conan Doyle&#x2019;s style, with Bao as the Watson-like-I narrator&#x2015;a still rare instance of so direct an appropriation from foreign fiction.</p><p>Cheng Xiaoqing wrote detective stories to introduce the advantages of critical thinking to his readers, to encourage them to be skeptical and think deeply, because truth often lies beneath surface appearances. His attraction to the detective fiction genre can be traced to its reconciliation of the traditional and the modern. In "The Shoe," Huo Sang solves the case with careful reasoning, while "The Other Photograph" and "On the Huangpu" blend this reasoning with a sensationalism reminiscent of traditional Chinese fiction. "The Odd Tenant" and "The Examination Paper" also demonstrate the folly of first impressions. "At the Ball" and "Cat&#x2019;s-Eye" feature the South-China Swallow, a master thief who, like other outlaws in traditional tales, steals only from the rich and powerful. "One Summer Night" clearly shows Cheng&#x2019;s strategy of captivating his Chinese readers with recognizably native elements even as he espouses more globalized views of truth and justice.</p></p><p>Timothy C. Wong is professor of Chinese at Arizona State University, where he teaches Chinese fiction and directs the graduate program in Asian Languages and Civilizations in the Department of Languages and Literatures.</p><h2>From Ritual to Romance</h2><p>From Ritual to Romance is a 1920 book written by Jessie Laidlay Weston. The work's current fame partly rests on it being mentioned by T.S. Eliot in the notes to his poem, The Waste Land. 'Not only the title, but the plan &amp; a good deal of the incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested by Miss Jessie L. Weston's book.' Weston's book is an academic examination of the roots of the King Arthur legends &amp; seeks to make connections between the early pagan elements &amp; the later Christian influences. The book's main focus is on the Holy Grail tradition &amp; its influence, particularly the Wasteland motif. The origins of Weston's book are in James George Frazer's seminal work on folklore, magic &amp; religion, The Golden Bough, &amp; in the works of Jane Ellen Harrison. The book appears in the film Apocalypse Now, among those kept by the character, Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando, along with The Golden Bough.

Ever refusing to be marginalized or categorized by genre, Maso is an incisive, compassionate writer who deems herself daughter of William Carlos Williams, a pioneer in combining poetry and fiction with criticism, journalism, and the visual arts. She is daughter, too, of Allen Ginsberg, who also came from Paterson, New Jersey. Known for her audacity, whether exploring language and memory or the development of the artistic soul, Maso here gives us a form-challenging collection, intelligent, and persuasive.</p><p>Carole Maso's novels (<i>Ava</i>, <i>The American Woman in the Chinese Hat</i>) have been called postmodern. Avant-garde. You do not devour them, as you might "popular" fiction. You give yourself over to them: to their meanderings, their idiosyncrasies, their eroticisms, their quirky narratives. Maso is tired of the typical <i>New Yorker</i> short story; she bemoans writers' willingness to conform in order to get published; and, yes, she is downright bored by those who think an essay should have "a hypothesis, a conclusion, [and] should argue points." While it is clear from these essays that Maso rails against a white-male publishing establishment, she is not so much a contrarian as simply determined to do it her way--even if she has to move to Europe to escape the influence of others.<p> From the start, says Maso, "I was never much for ordinary narrative.... Even as a child ... I would wander year after year in and out of our bedtime reading room, dissatisfied by the stories, the silly plot contrivances, the reduction of an awesome complicated world into a rather silly, sterile one." Fiction, she feels, should offer "a place for the random, the accidental, the overheard, the incidental." She sees the novel not as a neat, little self-contained package, but "as a huge, shifting, unstable, unmanageable canvas. Smudged with lipstick, fingerprints, crumpled, tear-stained, many-paged." In these 10 essays, Maso alights on her feelings about language and fiction, the teaching of creative writing ("part of why I'm here is to teach them to be bad, to question, to disobey"), her friendship with the composer Gustave Richter, gay and lesbian writing, and countless other topics. The book meanders. It is idiosyncratic and poetic. No matter your feelings about traditional narrative--and traditional essay form--you can't help but be moved by Maso's ability to live and work outside the lines and by her unbounded passion for language. "When I write sentences I am at home...." says Maso. "In the gloating, enormous strangeness and solitude of the real world, where I am so often inconsolable, marooned, utterly dizzied, all I need do is to pick up a pen and begin to write--safe in the shelter of the alphabet--and I am taken home." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>Carole Maso is the author of seven books including Ghost Dance and Break Every Rule. She is a professor of English at Brown University.</p><h2>A Warmth in Winter (Heavenly Daze Series #3)</h2><p><p>Readers have already fallen in love with the quirky personalities that inhabit Heavenly Daze. In <em>A Warmth in Winter</em>, the unforgettable characters and humorous circumstances offer poignant lessons of God's love and faithfulness. The story centers around Vernie Bidderman, owner of Mooseleuk Mercantile and Salt Gribbon, the lighthouse operator, who despite the vast differences in their struggles are being taught about the ultimate failure and frustration of self-reliance.</p></p><p><p>Lori Copeland is a&nbsp;bestselling author whose books includde Now and Always, Simple Gifts, Unwrapping Christmas, and Monday Morning Faith, which was a finalist for the 2007 Christy Awards. Lori was inducted into the Springfield Writers Hall of Fame in 2000 and lives in the beautiful Ozarks with her husband and family.</p><p><br> CHAPTER ONE:</p> <b>O</b>n Saturday morning, Salt Gribbon looked across the expanse of his small home in the lighthouse and thanked God, not for the first time, that the busybody at the yard sale in Wells had insisted on selling the wooden table with its four matching chairs. At the time he'd groused plenty because he only had one bottom and therefore needed only one chair, but the woman wouldn't budge. Even after she agreed to toss in the other three chairs without charge, he had half a mind to leave the excess furniture on the shore, until his Yankee thriftiness rebelled against such waste. So he'd turned the table upside down in his dory, lashed the chairs into position between the legs, and rowed the entire load back to the northernmost point of Heavenly Daze. <p>Now three of his four chairs were occupied, one by his own weathered behind, and the others by the slender rear ends of his grandchildren, seven-year-old Bobby and six-year-old Brittany. The children, tousle-headed and heavy-eyed with sleep, were munching on molasses cookies, one of their favorite breakfasts.</p> <p>"Grandfather," Brittany said, breaking one of the cookies with a deft snap, "don't you have Froot Loops? We always had Froot Loops for breakfast when we lived with Daddy." </p> <p>"We never had Froot Loops." Bobby cast his sister a reproving look. "Sometimes we had cold pizza, but most times we had nothing." </p> <p>Biting his tongue, Salt scratched his beard and watched his granddaughter. The little girl had a tendency to embroider the truth, especially when the subject had to do with her father, Salt's only son.</p> <p>Holding her pinkie finger aloft-how'd she learn to do that?-Brittany dunked the end of her cookie into her glass of milk. "I like these cookies better than anything we had at Daddy's 'partment. The pizza was always cold. And we never had milk, only soda pop." </p> <p>Salt's heart squeezed so tight he could barely draw breath to speak, but he forced words out: "The Good Book teaches us to be grateful for whatever we have. So eat up and get dressed, kids. We have work to do today." </p> <p>Actually, he had work to do, but he believed young ones should keep themselves busy as well. These two stood in a particular need of structure and discipline. Their father had done almost nothing to teach his children. He'd led a life of waste and drunkenness, leaving these kids to grow up on a diet of television, table scraps, and neglect. </p> <p>Bobby reached for another cookie at the same moment Brittany extended her hand. Both sets of fingers met on the edges of the last one on the plate. </p> <p>Bobby spoke first. "I want it." </p> <p>"It's mine!" </p> <p>"But I grabbed it before you did." </p> <p>"Did not!"</p> <p>"Did too!" </p> <p>In the ensuing tug of war, their tiny hands knocked over Bobby's glass. As the milk spread over the varnished tabletop, both children dropped the cookie and averted their eyes until Salt stood to reach for a dishcloth. After tossing it into the worst of the puddle, he crossed his arms and stood at the end of the table, waiting. </p> <p>Two pairs of guilty eyes eventually lifted to meet his. </p> <p>"You see what happens when you mess around?" he asked, hoping they'd attribute the gruffness in his voice to anger instead of heartbreak. "You waste good milk that you need. You're both too scrawny, and now I'll have to go into town to get more to replace what you spilt." </p> <p>He lifted his arm, intending to reach for the dishcloth, and winced inwardly when he saw the boy flinch. </p> <p>What sort of monster had his son been? "Finish your cookies." He lowered his gaze lest they see the shimmer of wetness in his eyes. "Then go pick a book out of the stack. I want you both to read a good bit today." </p> <p>Without taking another bite, both children slipped silently from the table and moved toward the small TV stand by the fireplace. Bobby plucked Curious George from the pile of books on a shelf under the TV; Brittany picked up Betsy-Tacy and Tib. Moving like quiet little robots, they sat cross-legged in the vinyl beanbag chairs and opened their books. </p> <p>Salt shook his head as he wiped up the spilled milk. 'Twas un-natural, the way they responded to rebuke. Though the bruises had faded from their young bodies, the scars on their hearts would take longer to heal. </p> <p>By the time Salt had washed the dishes, changed out of the long-handled underwear that served as his pajamas, and pulled the quilts over the mattress on his rope bed, the children had finished their reading. Still they sat in the beanbag chairs, apparently waiting permission to move. </p> <p>"All right, then." Salt sank to the edge of the bed as he regarded them. "You've done a good job of obeyin' and readin'. Now I must ask you to do a good job of something else." </p> <p>The children watched him, their eyes wide. </p> <p>Salt pointed toward the lighthouse door. "Alst I ask is that you don't go outside while I'm gone. Stay here in the house. If anybody tries to come inside, you scoot under this bed and lay as quiet as statues until the stranger leaves."

He discovers the remnants of a lavish pool party. The revelers have fled, leaving three dead bodies in their wake, all shot with the same gun. One is an acclaimed film producer. The other two, a pair of gorgeous women. <p></p>With his new partner, Sumner &#x201c;Hitch&#x201d; Hitchens, Scully begins to investigate what looks to be an open-and-shut case: The women were hired prostitutes, and there&#x2019;s security video of an angry husband firing on all three. A simple case of brutal revenge. But nothing is ever as simple as it seems: There&#x2019;s a single spent bullet casing that doesn&#x2019;t match the rest. &nbsp;From that single bullet emerges a story of love, murder, suicide, and one of the biggest financial frauds in L.A. history. Someone has gone to great lengths to cover up a decades-old crime, and as Scully and Hitch get closer to the answer, they find themselves in a killer&#x2019;s crosshairs.</p><p>Stephen J.

I have always felt that the beauty and power of Quakerism is that it exhorts us to live more simply, more truthfully, more charitably."</p><p>Taking his inspiration from the teaching of the first Quaker, George Fox, and from his own nine generations of Quaker forebears, Smith speaks to all of us who are seeking a way to make our lives simpler, more meaningful, and more useful. Beginning with the Quaker belief that "There is that of God in every person," Smith explores the ways in which we can harness the inner light of God that dwells in each of us to guide the personal choices and challenges we face every day. How to live and speak truthfully. How to listen for, trust, and act on our conscience. How to make our work an expression of the best that is in us.</p><p>Using vivid examples from his own life, Smith writes eloquently of Quaker Meeting, his decision to fight in World War II, and later to oppose the Vietnam War. From his work as an educator and headmaster to his role as a husband and father, Smith quietly convinces that the lofty ideals of Quakerism offer all of us practical tools for leading a more meaningful life. His book culminates with a moving letter to his grandchildren which imparts ten lessons for "letting your life speak."</p></p><p>During a traditional Quaker meeting, the Friends sit in silent meditation. No one speaks unless they are moved to do so through the "still, small voice" of God within. As a result, spoken words are often spare, clear, and wise. <i>A Quaker Book of Wisdom</i> reads like the voice of a Sunday morning meeting. Author Robert Lawrence Smith is a lifelong Quaker and former headmaster of the Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. (Chelsea Clinton's former alma mater). Reflecting on topics such as silence, simplicity, business, and family, Smith offers guidance on how to "let your life speak"--an important premise to the Quaker life of service. Smith's humble self-disclosures make this slim book especially endearing and accessible. In the chapter "Conscience," he divulges battlefield horrors that rival those in <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>--images that still haunt him long after he chose to fight fascism during World War II instead of becoming a conscientious objector, as many Quakers did. In the next chapter, "Non-Violence," Smith writes of an eye-opening shopping trip to Toys R Us where the action-figure warmongers are far more attractive to his grandson than the checkers game they were planning to purchase. In the final chapter, Smith offers "Ten Life Lessons" that he wishes someone had shared with him when he was growing up. Indeed, these lessons are even more valuable and certainly more provocative than the ones we learned in kindergarten. --<i>Gail Hudson</i>Robert Lawrence Smith is he former headmaster of Sidwell Friends School in Washington. D.C., the country&#39;s largets Quaker day school. He served for ten years as the executive director of the Council for American Private Education and worked on the U.S. Senator Thomas Eagleton&#39;s professional staff for educational issues. He analyzed adult literacy programs for the Community Foundation of Greater Washington and helped design drug prevention programs for the Corporation Against Drug Abuse.

Clutching her books, she dashed across campus, in a rush to get home. By now the mail would have been delivered to her small rental house three blocks from the school.<br><br>"Ruth," Tina Dupont called, stopping her in mid-flight. "There's another antiwar rally this afternoon at&#x2014;"<br><br>"Sorry, I've got to run," Ruth said, jogging past her friend and feeling more than a little guilty. Other students cleared a path for her; wherever she was headed must have seemed urgent&#x2014;and it was, but only to her. Since Christmas, four months ago, she'd been corresponding with Sergeant Paul Gordon, USMC, who was stationed in Afghanistan. There'd been recent reports of fighting, and she hadn't received a letter or an email from Paul in three days. Three interminable days. Not since they'd initially begun their correspondence had there been such a lapse. Paul usually wrote every day and she did, too. They emailed as often as possible. Ruth had strong feelings about the war in Iraq, although her opinions didn't match those of her parents.<br><br>Earlier in the school year, Ruth had been part of a protest rally on campus. But no matter what her political views on the subject, she felt it was important to support American troops wherever they might be serving. In an effort to do that, Ruth had voluntarily mailed a Christmas card and letter to a nameless soldier.<br><br>Paul Gordon was the young man who'd received that Christmas card, and to Ruth's surprise he'd written her back and enclosed his photograph. Paul was from Seattle and he'd chosen her card because of the Seattle postmark. He'd asked her lots of questions&#x2014;about her history, her family, her interests&#x2014;and closed with a postscript that said he hoped to hear from her again.<br><br>When she first got his letter, Ruth had hesitated. She felt she'd done her duty, supported the armed services in a way she was comfortable doing. This man she'd never met was asking her to continue corresponding with him. She wasn't sure she wanted to become that involved. Feeling uncertain, she'd waited a few days before deciding.<br><br>During that time, Ruth had read and reread his letter and studied the head shot of the clean-cut handsome marine sergeant in dress uniform. His dark brown eyes had seemed to stare straight through her&#x2014;and directly into her heart. After two days, she answered his letter with a short one of her own and added her email address at the bottom of the page. Ruth had a few concerns she wanted him to address before she could commit herself to beginning this correspondence. Being as straightforward and honest as possible, she explained her objections to the war in Iraq. She felt there was a more legitimate reason for troops to be in Afghanistan and wanted to know his stand. A few days later he emailed her. Paul didn't mince words. He told her he believed the United States had done the right thing in entering Iraq and gave his reasons. He left it up to her to decide if she wanted to continue their correspondence. Ruth emailed him back and once again listed her objections to the American presence in the Middle East. His response came a day later, suggesting they "agree to disagree." He ended the email with the same question he'd asked her earlier. Would she write him?<br><br>At first, Ruth wasn't going to. They were diametrically opposed in their political views. But in the end, even recognizing the conflict between their opinions, she did write. Their correspondence started slowly. She enjoyed his wry wit and his unflinching determination to make a difference in the world. His father had fought in Vietnam, he said, and in some ways the war in Afghanistan seemed similar&#x2014;the hostile terrain, the unpredictability of the enemy, the difficult conditions. For her part, she mentioned that at twenty-five she'd returned to school to obtain her master's of education degree. Then, gradually, without being fully aware of how it had happened, Ruth found herself spending part of every day writing or emailing Paul. Despite the instant nature of email, and its convenience, they both enjoyed interspersing their online messages with more formal letters. There was something so...permanent about a real letter. As well, depending on his duty assignment, Paul didn't always have computer access.<br><br>After they'd been corresponding regularly for a couple of months, Paul asked for her picture. Eventually she'd mailed him her photograph, but only after she'd had her hair and makeup done at one of those "glamour" studios. Although she wasn't fashion-model beautiful, she considered herself fairly attractive and wanted to look her absolute best for Paul, although she didn't entirely understand why it mattered so much. For years, she'd been resigned to the fact that she wasn't much good at relationships. In high school she'd been shy, and while she was an undergraduate, she'd dated a little but tended to be reserved and studious. Her quiet manner didn't seem to appeal to the guys she met. It was only when she stepped in front of a classroom that she truly became herself. She loved teaching, every single aspect of it. In the process, Ruth lost her hesitation and her restraint, and to her astonishment discovered that this enthusiasm had begun to spill over into the rest of her life. Suddenly men started to notice her. She enjoyed the attention&#x2014;who wouldn't?&#x2014;and had dated more in the past few months than in the preceding four years.<br><br>For the picture, her short brown hair had been styled in loose curls. Her blue eyes were smiling and friendly, which was exactly the impression she hoped to convey. She was a little shocked by the importance of Paul's re-action&#x2014;by her need that he find her attractive.<br><br>She waited impatiently for his response. A week later she received an email. Paul seemed to like what he saw in her photograph and soon they were writing and emailing back and forth at a feverish pace. A day without some form of communication from Paul felt empty now.<br><br>Ruth had never had a long-distance relationship before, and the growing intensity of her feelings for this man she'd never met took her by surprise. She wasn't a teenager with a schoolgirl crush. Ruth was a mature, responsible adult. Or at least she had been until she slipped a simple Christmas card into the mailbox&#x2014;and got a reply from a handsome marine sergeant named Paul Gordon.<br><br>Ruth walked quickly to the rental house she shared with Lynn Blumenthal, then ran up the front steps to the porch. Lynn was eighteen and away from home and family for the first time. The arrangement suited both of them, and despite the disparity in their ages and interests, they'd gotten along fairly well. With her heart pounding hard, Ruth forced herself to draw in a deep breath as she started toward the mailbox.<br><br>The screen door flew open and Lynn came out. "What are you doing home?" she asked, then shook her head. "Never mind, I already know. You're looking for a letter from soldier boy."<br><br>Ruth wasn't going to deny the obvious. "I haven't heard from him in three days."<br><br>Lynn rolled her eyes. "I don't understand you."<br><br>"I know." Ruth didn't want to get into another discussion with her roommate. Lynn had made her feelings about this relationship known from the outset, although as Ruth had gently tried to tell her, it was none of her business. That didn't prevent the younger woman from expressing her views. Lynn said that Ruth was only setting herself up for heartache. A part of Ruth actually agreed, but by the time she realized what was happening, she was emotionally involved with Paul.<br><br>"You hardly ever see Clay anymore," Lynn chastised, hands on her hips. "He called and asked about you the other night."<br><br>Ruth stared at the small black mailbox. "Clay and I are just friends."<br><br>"Not according to him."<br><br>It was true that they'd been seeing each other quite a bit following a Halloween party last October. Like her, Clay Matthews was obtaining his master's of education, and they seemed to have a lot in common. But her interest in him had started to wane even before she'd mailed that Christmas card to Paul. The problem was, Clay hadn't noticed.<br><br>"I'm sorry he's disappointed."<br><br>"Clay is decent and hardworking, and the way you've treated him the last few months is...is terrible." Lynn, who at five foot ten stood a good seven inches taller than Ruth, could be intimidating, especially with her mouth twisted in that grimace of disapproval.<br><br>Ruth had tried to let Clay down easily, but it hadn't worked. They'd gone to the library together last Thursday. Unfortunately, that had been a mistake. She'd known it almost right away when Clay pressured her to have coffee with him afterward. It would've been better just to end the relationship and forget about staying friends. He was younger, for one thing, and while that hadn't seemed important earlier, it did now. Perhaps it was wrong to compare him to Paul, but Ruth couldn't help it. Measured against Paul, Clay seemed immature, demanding and insecure.<br><br>"You said he phoned?" Frowning, she glanced at Lynn.<br><br>Lynn nodded. "He wants to know what's going on."<br><br>Oh, brother! Ruth couldn't have made it plainer had she handed him divorce papers. Unwilling to be cruel, she'd tried to bolster his ego by referring to all the positive aspects of his personality&#x2014;but apparently, that had only led him to think the opposite of what she was trying to tell him. He'd refused to take her very obvious hints, and in her frustration, she'd bluntly announced that she wasn't interested in seeing him anymore. That seemed pretty explicit to her; how he could be confused about it left Ruth shaking her head.<br><br>The fact that he'd phoned and cried on her roommate's shoulder was a good example of what she found adolescent about his behavior. She was absolutely certain Paul would never do that. If he had a problem, he'd take it directly to the source.<br><br>"I think you're being foolish," Lynn said, and added, "Not that you asked my opinion."<br><br>"No, I didn't," Ruth reminded her, eyeing the mailbox again. There was an ornamental latticework design along the bottom, and looking through it, she could tell that the day's mail had been delivered. The envelope inside was white, and her spirits sank. There <em>had</em> to be something from Paul. If not a real letter, then an email.<br><br>"He wanted me to talk to you," Lynn was saying.<br><br>"Who did?" Ruth asked distractedly. She was dying to open the mailbox, but she wanted to do it in privacy.<br><br><em>"Clay"</em> Lynn cried, sounding completely exasperated. "Who else are we talking about?"<br><br>Suddenly Ruth understood. She looked away from the mailbox and focused her attention on Lynn. "You're attracted to him, aren't you?"<br><br>Lynn gasped indignantly. "Don't be ridiculous."<br><br>"Sit down," Ruth said, gesturing toward the front steps, where they'd often sat before. It was a lovely spring afternoon, the first week of April, and she needed to clear the air with her roommate before this got further out of hand.<br><br>"What?" Lynn said with a defensive edge. "You've got the wrong idea here. I was just trying to help a friend."<br><br>"Sit," Ruth ordered.<br><br>"I have class in twenty minutes and I&#x2014;" Lynn paused, scowling at her watch.<br><br>"Sit down."<br><br>The eighteen-year-old capitulated with ill grace. "All right, but I know what you're going to say." She folded her arms and stared straight ahead.<br><br>"I'm fine with it," Ruth said softly. "Go out with him if you want. Like I said earlier, I'm not interested in Clay."<br><br>"You would be if it wasn't for soldier boy."<br><br>Ruth considered that and in all honesty felt she could say, "Not so."<br><br>"I don't understand you," Lynn lamented a second time. "You marched in the rally against the war in Iraq. Afghanistan isn't all that different, and now you're involved with Paul what's-his-face and it's like I don't even know you anymore."<br><br>"Paul doesn't have anything to do with this."<br><br>"Yes, he does," Lynn insisted.<br><br>"I'm not going to have this conversation with you.

We live in a free society and we don't have to have the same opinion on these issues or anything else."<br><br>Lynn sighed and said nothing.<br><br>"I have the feeling none of this is really about Paul," Ruth said with deliberate patience. She hadn't known Lynn very long; they lived separate lives and so far they'd never had a problem. As roommates went, Ruth felt she was fortunate to have found someone as amicable as Lynn. She didn't want this difference of opinion about Clay&#x2014;and Paul&#x2014;to ruin that.<br><br>The other girl once again looked pointedly at her watch, as if to suggest Ruth say what she intended to say and be done with it.<br><br>"I don't want to see Clay," she said emphatically.<br><br>"You might have told him that."<br><br>"I tried."<br><br>Lynn glared at her. "You should've tried harder."<br><br>Ruth laughed, but not because she was amused. For whatever reason, Clay had set his sights on her and wasn't about to be dissuaded. Complicating matters, Lynn was obviously interested in him and feeling guilty and unsure of how to deal with her attraction.<br><br>"Listen," Ruth said. "I didn't mean to hurt Clay. He's a great guy and&#x2014;"<br><br>"You shouldn't have lied to him."<br><br>Ruth raised her eyebrows. "When did I lie to him?"<br><br>"Last week you said you were going to visit your grandmother in Cedar Cove and that was why you couldn't go out with him this weekend. I overheard you," she murmured.</p><h2>Plastic Cameras: Lo-Fi Photography in the Digital Age</h2><p><p><b>A practical guide to shooting with a plastic camera, with loads of tips and tricks</b></p> <p>Decidedly low-tech and highly idiosyncratic plastic cameras enable&nbsp;shooters&nbsp;to create images that, while not technically perfect, display a quirky sense of fun, spontaneity, and creative artiness.&nbsp;They&nbsp;tend to produce&nbsp;images where colors&nbsp;are typically richly over-saturated, exposure frequently off-kilter, and focus dreamily soft. Plastic cameras lack light meters, autofocus, auto film advance, adjustable shutters, and digital sensors, notoriously leak light onto the 120 or 35mm roll film they employ, and there are some wacky versions: flamboyant wide-angle fish-eyes, pinhole cameras that don't even possess a lens, and multi-lens cameras that create negatives combining up to nine images on a single 35mm frame. This book is the definitive guide to shooting with a plastic camera with tips on&nbsp;loading, advancing, and unloading film; using the viewfinder; dealing with the light leaks that can fog or streak the film; and camera modifications and reinforcements. Although the rule of shooting with plastic cameras is that there are no rules, the book suggests ways to get the most from these unpredictable devices, from&nbsp;capturing movement, producing multiple exposures, and shooting in low light conditions to dealing with flare, shooting close-ups, using flash, using filters, and more. There's also sound, practical advice on experimenting with film types, including&nbsp;black-and-white, infrared, color negative, transparency, and instant; film processing; and&nbsp;printing your images.</p></p><p><b>Chris Gatcum</b> is an award-winning photographer and contributor of technical and technique-based photography articles to numerous online and print publications.

Kamalashila's short work is not widely known today, but according to the Dalai Lama, it is a most important text, and worthy of study by those new to Buddhism, because "on the basis of this knowledge you will be able to understand other treatises without great difficulty. This text can be like a key that opens the door to all other major Buddhist scriptures."<p> Throughout the book, the Dalai Lama emphasizes the importance of logical analysis of scriptures, even if they are in the Buddha's own words; some teachings, he stresses, "should not be taken literally, but need interpretation." And this is what he does in this clear and readable commentary, originally given in 1989 and now translated and published for the first time. Its 10 short chapters are on such familiar Buddhist themes as Training the Mind, Compassion, Identifying the Nature of Suffering, and The Practice of Calm Abiding.</p><p> "Through meditation," says the Dalai Lama, "we can train our minds in such a way that negative qualities are abandoned and positive qualities are generated and enhanced." Those who practice meditation, whether Buddhist or not, will find this a thoughtful and practical guide, written with the Dalai Lama's characteristic warmth and gentleness. <i>--David V Barrett, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Born in Amdo, Tibet in 1935, Tenzin Gyatso was recognized as the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet.

But if you think humans have a tough time dating, try having to do it while being hunted down by predators, against a backdrop of unpredictable and life-threatening conditions. The animal kingdom is a wild place &#x2013; and it&#x2019;s got mating habits to match. The sex lives of our animal cousins are fiendishly difficult, infinitely varied, often incredibly violent &#x2015; and absolutely fascinating.<br><br> In <em>Wild Sex</em>, Dr. Carin Bondar takes readers on an enthralling tour of the animal kingdom as she explores the diverse world of sex in the wild. She looks at the evolution of sexual organs (and how they&#x2019;ve shaped social hierarchies), tactics of seduction, and the mechanics of sex. She investigates a wide range of topics, from whether animals experience pleasure from sex to what happens when females hold the reproductive power. Along the way, she encounters razor-sharp penises, murderous carnal cannibals, and spontaneous chemical warfare in an epic battle between the sexes.<br><br> The resulting book is titillating, exhilarating, amusing, petrifying, alluring &#x2015; and absolutely guaranteed to make you think about sex in a whole new way.</p><p>Dr. Carin Bondar received a PhD in population ecology from the University of British Columbia and has hosted a variety of online and television programs at Scientific American, PBS Digital Studios, and the Science Channel. She is also the author of Wild Sex and lives in British Columbia, Canada.&#x201c;As Bondar proves in <em>Wild Sex</em>, the world of animal mating can be much more complicated than trying to figure out if what you swiped right on is a catfish. <em>Wild Sex</em> looks at the animal laws of attraction, physical act of sex and reproduction patterns of several animal species, including the obstacles some animals must overcome to perpetuate their species: The male redback spider, for example, is consumed by its cannibalistic female partner after copulation. And you thought OkCupid was rough.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Chicago Tribune</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Carin Bondar&#x2019;s fascinating study is a sort of &#x2018;everything you wanted to know about wildlife sex but were afraid to ask.&#x2019; Nookie in the wild is a complete stranger to political correctness.

The piping-hot coffee and chilly orange juice you purchased just minutes ago are now both disappointingly lukewarm. Why can't the coffee "steal" heat from the juice to stay hot? Why does even the most state-of-the-art car operate at a mere 30 percent efficiency--and why can't Detroit ever better the odds, no matter what space age materials we invent? Why can't some genius make a perpetual motion machine? The answers lie in the field of thermodynamics, the study of heat, which turns out to be the key to an astonishing number of scientific puzzles.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to know what's happening in the physical world, you've got to follow the heat. In Maxwell's Demon: Why Warmth Disperses and Time Passes, physics professor Hans Christian von Baeyer tells the story of heat through the lives of the scientists who discovered it, most notably James Clerk Maxwell, whose demonic invention has bedeviled generations of physics students with its light-fingered attempts to flout the laws of thermodynamics. An intelligent, submicroscopic gremlin who could sort atoms as they<br>flew at him, Maxwell's Demon would effectively make an impossible task--forcing heat to flow backward--possible. Explaining why the Demon can't have his day has been an intellectual gauntlet taken up by a century and a half of the world's most brilliant scientists, whose discoveries Professor von Baeyer vividly etches.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The centuries-old discipline of thermodynamics informs today's most cutting-edge research in chaos, complexity, and the grand unified theory of everything--physics' Holy Grail. Even more amazing, the study of heat turns out to explain something seemingly unrelated--time, and why it can run in only one direction.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his trademark elegant prose, eye for lively detail, and gift for lucid explanation, Professor von Baeyer turns the contemplation of a cooling teacup into a beguiling portrait of the birth of a science with relevance to almost every aspect of our lives. Readers will find themselves rooting for Maxwell's ever-mischievous Demon even as they come to appreciate that he is doomed to failure.</p><p>What's the most depressing law of physics? Why, the second law of thermodynamics, of course! In a nutshell: entropy (or disorder) is always increasing, leading to the inevitable "heat death of the universe." Quite a dismal prospect, but even the most optimistic don't expect to be around when it all ends, long after our sun burns out. In <i>Maxwell's Demon: Why Warmth Disperses and Time Passes</i>, physics professor Hans Christian von Baeyer tells the story of the discovery and development of the second law of thermodynamics. The book is named for James Clerk Maxwell's little imaginary genius, who could make your latte boil out of your travel mug given a chance. Von Baeyer treats us to a wide-ranging survey of the early days of thermodynamics, the demon's multiple deaths and rebirths, and an explanation of why entropy's not such a bad thing after all.<p> Von Baeyer has a terrific knack for knowing what's interesting about his topic and sharing that interest through examples, quotations, and personal stories. Whether you're reading about the exploits of Count Rumford, who established that heat is not a substance, or the author's daughters, who perform hundreds of coin flips to satisfy themselves about the statistical nature of reality, you'll pick up the author's enthusiasm for science and thermodynamics. The broad scope, covering over 700 years in just over 200 pages, serves its subject well, as the law took a long time to reach its present form. If you're looking for a fascinating scientific history, or just an excuse for a messy room, <i>Maxwell's Demon</i> is the right choice. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Praise for Hans Christian von Baeyer's Previous Books <br> <br> <br>Taming the Atom: <br> <br>"No one has told the amazing history of atomism more accurately or more entertainingly. . . .

In 1928, Arthur Waley, a seminal figure in the Western studies of Japanese culture, undertook a translation. The distinguished scholar devised this abridged version of the text, re-creating in English the stylistic beauty of its prose and the vitality of its narrative. Waley's interpretation offers a fascinating glimpse of the artistic pursuits of the royal court and its constant round of rituals, festivals, and ceremonies.</p><p></p><h2>Outsider in the White House</h2><p><b>The political autobiography of the insurgent presidential candidate</b><br><br> Bernie Sanders&#x2019;s campaign for the presidency of the United States has galvanized people all over the country, putting economic, racial, and social justice into the spotlight, and raising hopes that Americans can take their country back from the billionaires and change the course of history.<br><br> In this book, Sanders tells the story of a passionate and principled political life.

He was not among the cadre of reporters and photographers assigned to cover the Dallas visit of President John F. Kennedy. Within thirty-six hours, however, Aynesworth had witnessed the assassination of the president, the arrest of the assassin, and the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby. Now fifty years later, Witness to History recounts events that have passed into memory and controversy&#x2014;and sets the record straight. In his intriguing behind-the-scenes narrative, Aynesworth recreates the harrowing hours following the president's death; builds portraits of the assassin's mother and wife; and engages readers as eyewitnesses to the frenetic aftermath. &#x201c;The rifle shots had barely stopped echoing over Dealey Plaza that Friday afternoon a half century ago before untruths, both innocent and deliberate, began to distort the record and creep uncorrected in the world's consciousness.&#x201d; From the perspective of fifty years and with an investigative reporter's passion for facts, Aynesworth dispels false accounts and reveals the truth about those who sought to profit from their fortuitous (or manufactured) connection to the assassination.Four-time Pulitzer Prize finalist, bureau chief of both Newsweek and the Washington Times,&nbsp;and investigative team leader for ABC's 20/20, Hugh Aynesworth was a thirty-two-year-old reporter for the Dallas Morning News when JFK's visit to Dallas ended in tragedy. His coverage of the assassination, the trial of Jack Ruby, and the conspiracy flurry that followed earned him two Pulitzer nominations and recognition as one of the most respected authorities on the Kennedy assassination. His reporting of Martin Luther King's assassination, the 1993 Branch Davidian standoff and fire, and the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City marked his career advancement from a small-town sports editor to bureau chief.

The piano player invites you up on stage to meet the musicians after the set is finished. You listen to them talkabout the tempo of the last tune, the order of songs for their next set, and the different jazz greats they admire.</p><p><i>What Jazz Is</i> gives you the experience of "being there" as Jonny King takes you on stage and into the core of modern jazz. From the unique perspective of a professional jazz pianist, King explores the basic elements and language of jazz. He explains each instrument's role in locking in the tempo, establishing the harmony, and stating the melody, and he reveals the order and logic behind the seeming randomness of improvisation. Along the way, he celebrates the distinctive playing styles of such classic jazz artists as Art Blakey, John Coltrane, and Thelonious Monk, as well as his contemporaries, such as Kenny Garrett, Christian McBride, and Joshua Redman. Whether you are about to attend a jazz club for the first time or buy your umpteenth CD, your listening experience will be enhanced by reading this eloquent and passionate account of how jazz works and why it sizzles!</p></p><p><p><b>Jonny King</b> has played jazz piano since he was nine. He has performed extensively throughout the United States, Europe, Asia, and South America, and <i>Downbeat</i> magazine described him as "One of the strongest piano voices of the new generation." His three albums include <i>Notes from the Underground</i> and <i>The Meltdown</i>. King is also an attorney specializing in copyright law. He lives in New York City.</p>There have been many jazz appreciation primers over the years, but none clearer and more accessible than King's, and, of course, his is up-to-date. A pianist with two albums as leader to his credit, King describes jazz's musical basics (improvisation, musical conversation, and swing) and the elements crucial to its performance (the rhythm section of bass, drums, and piano; the melodic voices of horns, other instruments, and singers; and the set list or on-the-spot performing repertoire) both abstractly for those who know virtually no jazz (e.g., onomatopoeically representing musical effects) and by reference to particular musicians' characteristics (e.g., bassist Ron Carter's "smooth attack where each note is articulated but sustains into the note that follows") for those with some listening experience. The final third of the book he devotes to guiding readers through some classic recorded performances exemplifying various common jazz forms (blues, ballads, etc.). This is a staple tactic of jazz primers that King recharges by choosing working musicians' rather than critics' favorites to analyze and by restricting his sampling scope to the middle 1950s through the 1960s, the period most influential upon today's jazz mainstream. So quit moanin' low, "I can't get started." Take some time out with King, and start cookin'. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>Globalizing Capital: A History of the International Monetary System (IMF)</h2><p><br> <p>The importance of the international monetary system is clearly evident in daily news stories about fluctuating currencies and in dramatic events such as the recent reversals in the Mexican economy. It has become increasingly apparent that one cannot understand the international economy without knowing how its monetary system operates. Now Barry Eichengreen presents a brief, lucid book that tells the story of the international financial system over the past 150 years. <i>Globalizing Capital</i> is intended not only for economists but also for a general audience of historians, political scientists, professionals in government and business, and anyone with a broad interest in international economic and political relations. Eichengreen's work demonstrates that insights into the international monetary system and effective principles for governing it can result only if it is seen a historical phenomenon extending from the gold standard period to interwar instability, then to Bretton Woods, and finally to the post-1973 period of fluctuating currencies.</p><br> <p>Eichengreen analyzes the shift from pegged to floating exchange rates in the 1970s and ascribes that change to the growing capital mobility that has made pegged rates difficult to maintain. However, he shows that capital mobility was also high prior to World War I, yet this did not prevent the maintenance of fixed exchange rates. What was critical for the successful maintenance of fixed exchange rates during that period was the fact that governments were relatively insulated from democratic politics and thus from pressure to trade off exchange rate stability for other goals, such as the reduction of unemployment. Today pegging exchange rates would require very radical reforms of a sort that governments are understandably reluctant to embrace. The implication seems undeniable: floating rates are here to stay.</p><br></p><p><br> <p>"Eichengreen's purpose is to provide a brief history of the international monetary system. In this, he succeeds magnificently. <i>Globalizing Capital</i> will become a classic."<b>--Douglas Irwin, author of <i>Against the Tide: An Intellectual History of Free Trade</i><br> </b><br> </p><br>"This book by a prominent economic historian is a succinct and well-written history of the international monetary system--the general framework in which financial transactions among residents of different countries take place--and its evolution....

Cooper, <i>Foreign Affairs</i><br> </b><br>"Capital flows in the recent period, unlike those in the earlier one, proved to be incompatible with exchange rate stability.

When a cop investigates, he finds two killers and a startling legacy of honor ... In a prestigious London art gallery an impoverished actor is swindled out of a fortune-until an eccentric appraiser hatches a delicious scheme for revenge... On an airplane high over war-torn Afghanistan, a passenger sends a note to the plane's captain, warning of suspicious behavior. But no one can guess who is really conspiring aboard the 747, or why... From the war-torn Italy to the Little Big Horn, from soldiers of fortune to victims of fate,<i>The Veteran</i> is a riveting experience in crime, heroism, and the kind of mano-a-mano duels-and surprising twists of fate-that are the hallmark of Frederick Forsyth at his very best.<br></p><p><b>Penzler Pick, September 2001:</b> Frederick Forsyth is known as the bestselling author of classic thrillers such as <i>The Day of the Jackal</i> and <i>The Odessa File</i>, among others. He is far less known as one of our premier short story writers (even though he won an Edgar for "There Are No Snakes in Ireland"), so it is a pleasure to have a new book from this superb storyteller.<p> "The Veteran" tells the story of an incident in one of the seedier parts of London. A Ugandan shopkeeper witnesses the mugging of a middle-aged man by two thugs. The shopkeeper has a perfect view of the crime so, when the man dies of his injuries, it would appear that the two thugs, now up on a murder charge, will be convicted. But justice does not always come easily, and it comes in many guises.</p><p> "The Art of the Matter" recounts an ingenious and deliciously satisfying art scam. The twists and turns are breathlessly entertaining and just when you think it's over, there's one more way for the bad guys to get their comeuppance. "The Miracle" tells the story of an American couple in Siena on their way to a festival. They are stopped when a stranger tells them the story of the courtyard in which they stand. Some very wonderful things happened right there during the Second World War. Will the couple get to the festival? Will they care? </p><p> "The Citizen" is a heart-stopping suspense story set on board a flight from Bangkok to London. We get to know the flight crew and some of the passengers very well, and they are not all who they might appear to be. And "Whispering Wind," the longest story in the book, is a very ambitious piece about the Battle of Little Big Horn and what came later for several of the participants. </p><p> Each of the stories in this volume is Forsyth in top form. The writing exceeds expectations, the stories are never less than compelling, and the suspense in each of them is nonstop. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>Christopher Cazenove, Patrick Macnee of The Avengers, and Bruce Boxleitner add their personal flair to Frederick Forsyth&#39;s new five novellas.

"If you got money, people can't take stuff from you--not your house, or your ride, not your family. They can't do nothing much to you, if you got a bankroll backing you up." Thirteen-year-old Raspberry Hill knows what it's like not to have security. After leaving her drug-addicted father, Raspberry and her mother lived on friends' couches and on the street before they landed in the projects. Now, while Raspberry's mom works two jobs and goes to school, Raspberry obsessively does anything she can to grow that bankroll to back her up; she sells pencils and old candy; cleans houses for the elderly; and washes cars at stoplights. Her three close friends both support her and mock her. There's Mia, who fights against her Korean and African American parents, wanting to identify herself only as black; Ja'nae, who lives with loving grandparents but yearns for her flaky, estranged mother; and Zora, whose divorced physician father, Dr. Mitchell, seems to be romancing Raspberry's mother, which upsets both girls. The razor-sharp dialogue and unerring details evoke characters, rooms, and neighborhoods with economy and precision, creating a story that's immediate, vivid, and unsensationalized. Without synthetic drama or stereotypes, Flake shows poverty and how it touches everyone, whether it's the actual absence of money or the fear of losing it. A few of the characters are less developed; Dr. Mitchell in particular is vague and a little too perfect. But Flake creates scenes of heart-stopping tenderness and tension between Raspberry and her friends and especially with her mother, as they struggle to leave the projects, suffering breakdowns and break-ins along the way, finally moving into a house of their own. Whatever teens' own familial insecurities may be, they will read something of their own lives in this title from the author of <i>The Skin I'm In </i>(1998). <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Johnson, the Great Society, and the Limits of Liberalism</h2><p>President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society was breathtaking in its scope and dramatic in its impact. Over the course of his time in office, Johnson passed over one thousand pieces of legislation designed to address an extraordinary array of social issues. Poverty and racial injustice were foremost among them, but the Great Society included legislation on issues ranging from health care to immigration to education and environmental protection. But while the Great Society was undeniably ambitious, it was by no means perfect. In <i>Prisoners of Hope</i>, prize-winning historian Randall B. Woods presents the first comprehensive history of the Great Society, exploring both the breathtaking possibilities of visionary politics, as well as its limits.<br><br>Soon after becoming president, Johnson achieved major legislative victories with the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But he wasn't prepared for the substantial backlash that ensued. Community Action Programs were painted as dangerously subversive, at worst a forum for minority criminals and at best a conduit through which the federal government and the inner city poor could bypass the existing power structure. Affirmative action was rife with controversy, and the War on Poverty was denounced by conservatives as the cause of civil disorder and disregard for the law. As opposition, first from white conservatives, but then also some liberals and African Americans, mounted, Johnson was forced to make a number of devastating concessions in order to secure the future of the Great Society. Even as many Americans benefited, millions were left disappointed, from suburban whites to the new anti-war left to African Americans. The Johnson administration's efforts to draw on aspects of the Great Society to build a viable society in South Vietnam ultimately failed, and as the war in Vietnam descended into quagmire, the president's credibility plummeted even further.<br><br>A cautionary tale about the unintended consequences of even well-intentioned policy, <i>Prisoners of Hope</i> offers a nuanced portrait of America's most ambitious&#x2014;and controversial&#x2014;domestic policy agenda since the New Deal.<br></p><p><b>Randall B.

With telling anecdotes and historical perspective, Woods shows that out of the ashes of 1960s liberalism, the phoenix of Great Society domestic programs continues rising and stokes the controversies that dominate the political and public policy landscape today."<br><br><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br> [Woods] tells the story well in <i>Prisoners of Hope</i>, his solidly researched history of the Great Society Early in his narrative, Mr. Woods makes an oft-neglected point: The first building block of the Great Society was the great tax cut of 1964.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Open Letters Monthly</i></b><br> <i>Prisoners of Hope</i> is a deeply-researched and wonderfully readable account of one of the most important barrages of legislation ever enacted in American history Woods is excellent throughout his book in assessing LBJ's effectiveness [He] provides a very insightful excavation of the maneuverings of the 20th century's most enigmatic US president.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Christian Science Monitor</i></b><br> <i>Prisoners of Hope</i> fully, shrewdly chronicles LBJ's Great Society.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Washington Post</b></i><br> This engaging and comprehensive narrative allows us to see the connections between different pieces of liberal reform Woods has a keen eye for the illuminating story <i>Prisoners of Hope</i> is a sweeping history of LBJ's domestic record.

Anyone who wants to understand our current political struggles should read this book.&#x201d;<br><br><b>John M Cooper, Professor Emeritus at the University of Wisconsin</b><br> <i>In Prisoners of Hope</i>, Randall Woods draws upon a deep understanding of Lyndon Johnson and his circle and their political circumstances to execute the best portrait of the Great Society that anyone has done. Acutely sensitive to both LBJ's gargantuan gifts and inescapable flaws, Woods unflinchingly depicts the failures and limitations of the man and his deeds, but, more important, he demonstrates their successes and lasting legacy. America in the twenty-first century is, indeed, the land that he loved and tried to shape.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Thomas J. Sugrue, author of <i>Sweet Land of Liberty: The Forgotten Struggle for Civil Rights in the North</i></b><br> Learned and deeply researched, Randall Woods has written the history of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society that we have long needed. Johnson's social programs were so ambitious that most historians have focused on bits and pieces. Woods does something much bolder: he ties it all together, attentive to the politics and ideas, the social movements, and the nitty gritty politics that made the mid-1960s a moment of policy innovation. This is a must-read book.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Entertainer: Movies, Magic, and My Father&#39;s Twentieth Century</h2><p>Using the life and career of her father, an early Hollywood actor, <i>New Yorker </i>writer Margaret Talbot tells the thrilling story of the rise of popular culture through a transfixing personal lens. The arc of Lyle Talbot&#x2019;s career is in fact the story of American entertainment. Born in 1902, Lyle left his home in small-town Nebraska in 1918 to join a traveling carnival. From there he became a magician&#x2019;s assistant, an actor in a traveling theater troupe, a romantic lead in early talkies, then an actor in major Warner Bros. pictures with stars such as Humphrey Bogart and Carole Lombard, then an actor in cult B movies, and finally a part of the advent of television, with regular roles on <i>The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet </i>and <i>Leave It to Beaver</i>. Ultimately, his career spanned the entire trajectory of the industry.<p>In her captivating, impeccably researched narrative&#x2014;a charmed combination of Hollywood history, social history, and family memoir&#x2014;Margaret Talbot conjures warmth and nostalgia for those earlier eras of &#x2019;10s and &#x2019;20s small-town America, &#x2019;30s and &#x2019;40s Hollywood. She transports us to an alluring time, simpler but also exciting, and illustrates the changing face of her father&#x2019;s America, all while telling the story of mass entertainment across the first half of the twentieth century.</p></p><p>Margaret Talbot has been a staff writer for <i>The New Yorker </i>since 2003. Previously, she was a contributing writer at <i>The New York Times Magazine </i>and an editor at <i>The New Republic</i>. She lives in Washington, D.C.&#x201c;Sharp and engaging . . . Talbot p�re comes across as a sort of Zelig-with-personality, a life-embracing man whose career spans, and illuminates, the first 60 years of the 20th century.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"A&nbsp;well-researched and clear-eyed history of the early American entertainment industry told through the perspective of a Zelig-like figure who worked with everyone from Shirley Temple to Mae West to Ed Wood. Talbot fille draws from historical sources as well as her own recollection, and the result is less a walk down memory lane than a gateway to a bygone era."&#x2014;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i><br><br>&#x201c;Margaret Talbot&#x2019;s wry, wonderful new book . . . That Talbot is a writer gifted enough to evoke not just images but their attendant music through her words will come as no surprise to anyone who&#x2019;s read her in&nbsp;<i>The&nbsp;New Yorker&nbsp;</i>or elsewhere. One of the things&nbsp;<i>The Entertainer&nbsp;</i>makes abundantly clear, though, is that she comes by her aesthetic sense naturally. . . . Talbot has woven a tale as romantic and vivid as any film could hope to be, while still seeing every bit of it plain. She is as clear-eyed about her father as she is about history&#x2014;no easy feat. . . . [Lyle] never had even a starring role as dazzling as the one his youngest child, with history as her guide, has now written for him.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Slate</i><br><br>"In <i>The Entertainer: Movies, Magic and My Father's Twentieth Century</i>, <i>New Yorker</i> staff writer Margaret Talbot succeeds at what Hollywood failed to do for her father: She makes him a star. . . . Talbot employs novelistic style in bringing this period to life . . . [and] vividly imagines her way into her father's world. . . . Lyle Talbot had one humdinger of a life story."&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"A tender but clear-eyed portrait &nbsp;. . . Like Lyle, this book is substantial but never heavy, with a sense of humor and an appreciation for the things that make life fun. While it may be true that Lyle Talbot 'led a resolutely unexamined life,' his daughter has written a story that gets to the heart of one of America&#x2019;s luckier, happier sons."&#x2014;<i>Boston Globe</i><br><br>&#x201c;Talbot, a staff writer for <i>The New Yorker</i>, has also accomplished something unusual. There are many books about actors written by their children. This may be the only one that's as much a century-spanning cultural history as a charming, affectionate tribute. . . .&nbsp;Talbot brings '30s Tinseltown to radiant life.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Newsday</i><br><br>"Deliciously written&nbsp;. . .&nbsp; [a] gleaming tribute of a book."&#x2014;<i>More</i><br><br>"A frolicking, applause-worthy memoir."&#x2014;<i>Good Housekeeping</i><br><br>"<i>New Yorker</i>&nbsp;staff writer Talbot debuts with an affectionate biography of her father, stage, screen and TV actor Lyle Talbot. Mingling memoir and relevant social and cultural history, the author shows how her father&#x2019;s career in many ways paralleled the changes in the 20th-century entertainment industry. . . . A thorough, lovingly researched paean to a father and a way of life."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus</i><br><br>&#x201c;What a wonderful, loving, beautifully researched and touching story this is! Lyle Talbot lived a charmed life&#x2014;a player's life&#x2014;from the final days of vaudeville to the golden years of American television. Somehow through it all (the glamour, the hardship, the stardom, the rejection and the many transformations of modernity) he comported himself with a dignity that feels very much out of time to a contemporary reader. His daughter's tender yet clear-headed remembrance of him is a gift and a treasure&#x2014;and a top-notch documentation of Hollywood history, besides.&#x201d;&#x2014;Elizabeth Gilbert, author of <i>Eat Pray Love</i>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The real life of consummate entertainer Lyle Talbot turns out to be his most unforgettable role. He seems to have been part of every stage of the rise of the modern entertainment industry, yet perhaps his greatest fortune was to have his story so beautifully rendered by his daughter. Weaving together cultural history, biography, and delightful backstage accounts, Margaret Talbot has created a classic of narrative nonfiction&#x2014;one that would have enthralled even the great man himself.&#x201d;&#x2014;David Grann, author of <i>The Lost City of Z</i><br><br>&#x201c;Some people are born storytellers. Some people are born with a story to tell. Margaret Talbot is both. <i>The Entertainer </i>is a&nbsp;gorgeously detailed and relentlessly inventive portrait of her father's adventures in 1930s Hollywood and on the home front.&#x201d;&#x2014;Karen Abbot, author of <i>Sin in the Second City</i><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Had Margaret Talbot devoted her beguiling prose simply to retelling her father's golden stories of Broadway and Hollywood, The Entertainer would be wonderful. Instead she has entwined those stories with a superb history of what used to be called 'the show business,' and written a brilliant and important book that touches the core of our national experience.&#x201d;&#x2014;Sean Wilentz, author of <i>Bob Dylan in America</i><br><br>"In this beautiful book&#x2014;part memoir, part history&#x2014;Margaret Talbot tells a family story of the American movie industry."&#x2014;Deborah Blum, author of&nbsp;<i>The&nbsp;Poisoner's Handbook</i>&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i><br><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Raw Vegetable Juices</h2><p>Are you &#34;dying&#34; for a good meal?

Vital for Ceremonial Magicians of all forms.</p><p>The <i>Three Books of Occult Philosophy</i> by Agrippa is the single most important text in the history of Western occultism. Even today, occultists use the techniques first described here, although rarely giving credit to it. <br> <br>Barrett's <i>The Magus</i> is a direct plagiarism of a part of this book. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn's systems of the Kabbalah, geomancy, elements, and seals and squares of the planets are all taken, in a large measure, from Agrippa&#x2014;but for 500 years, <i>Three Books of Occult Philosophy</i> was almost impossible to find. <br> <br>Donald Tyson took on the Herculean task of digging out the original, correcting the errors, and fully annotating the entire work. As a result, not only is this new edition easily available to scholars, but it is now fully understandable by people today. The ancient magics, in their original form, live again. <br> <br>Besides the annotations, there are also extensive appendices on such topics as the elements, the magical squares, the humors, and more. Biographical and geographical dictionaries and the general index make accessing and understanding information in this book easier than ever. <br> <br>This is the ultimate version of the book that is the ultimate book on magic. If you are interested in any form of magic or occultism, you must get <i>Three Books of Occult Philosophy. <br></i><p>Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim (1486-1535) was a German magician, occult writer, theologian, astrologer, and alchemist.</p> <p>Editor Donald Tyson is a Canadian from Halifax, Nova Scotia. &nbsp;Early in life he was drawn to science by an intense fascination with astronomy.&nbsp; He now devotes his life to the attainment of a complete gnosis of the art of magic in theory and practice. &nbsp;His purpose is to formulate an accessible system of personal training composed of East and West, past and present, that will help the individual discover the reason for one's existence and a way to fulfill it.</p></p><h2>An Iliad</h2><p>A bold reimagining of our civilization&#x2019;s greatest tale of war, by the author of the acclaimed best seller <i>Silk</i>.<br><br>Alessandro Baricco re-creates the siege of Troy through the voices of twenty-one Homeric characters in the narrative idiom of our modern imagination. Sacrificing none of Homer&#x2019;s panoramic scope, Baricco forgoes Homeric detachment and admits us to realms of subjective experience his predecessor never explored. From the return of Chryseis to the burial of Hector, we see through human eyes and feel with human hearts the unforgettable events first recounted almost three thousand years ago&#x2014;events arranged not by the whims of the gods in this instance but by the dictates of human nature. With Andromache, Patroclus, Priam, and the rest, we are privy to the ghastly confusion of battle, the clamor of princely councils, the intimacies of the bedchamber&#x2014;until finally only a blind poet is left to recount, secondhand, the awful fall of Ilium. <br><br>Imbuing the stuff of legend with a startling new relevancy and humanity, Baricco gives us <i>The</i> <i>Iliad</i> as we have never known it. His transformative achievement is certain to delight and fascinate all readers of Homer&#x2019;s indispensable classic.</p><p>Alessandro Baricco was born in Turin in 1958. The author of four previous novels, he has won the Prix M�dicis �tranger in France and the Selezione Campiello, Viareggio, and Palazzo al Bosco prizes in Italy. He lives in Rome.Chryseis<br>It all began on a day of violence.<br><br>For nine years the Achaeans had besieged Troy: often they needed provisions or animals or women, and then they abandoned the siege and went to get what they wanted by plundering the nearby cities. That day it was the turn of Thebes, my city. They seized what they wanted and brought it to their ships.<br><br>I was among the women they carried off. I was a beauty: when, in their camp, the Achaean chieftains divided up the spoils, Agamemnon saw me and wanted me for himself. He was the king of kings, and the commander of all the Achaeans: he brought me to his tent, and to his bed. He had a wife, at home, called Clytemnestra. He loved her. But that day he saw me and wanted me for himself.<br><br>Some days afterward my father came to the camp. His name was Chryses, and he was a priest of Apollo. He was an old man. He brought splendid gifts and asked the Achaeans, in exchange, to set me free. As I said: he was an old man and a priest of Apollo. All the Achaean chiefs, after seeing and listening to him, were in favor of accepting the ransom and honoring the noble figure who had come to them as a suppliant. Only one among them was not won over: Agamemnon. He rose and railed brutally against my father, saying to him, "Go away, old man, and don't show yourself again. I will not give up your daughter: she will grow old in Argos, in my house, far from her homeland, working at the loom and sharing my bed. Go now, if you want to go with your life."<br><br>My father, frightened, obeyed. He went away in silence and disappeared along the shore of the sea&#x2014;you might have said <i>into</i> the sound of the sea. Then, suddenly, death and suffering fell upon the Achaeans. For nine days, arrows flew, killing men and beasts, and the pyres of the dead blazed without respite. On the tenth day, Achilles summoned the army to a meeting. In front of all the men he said, "If things continue like this, we'll have to launch our ships and go home in order to escape death. But let's consult a prophet, or a seer, or a priest who can tell us what is happening and free us from this scourge."<br><br>Then Calchas rose, the most famous among the seers. He knew all the things that have been, are, and will be. He was a wise man. He said, "You want to know the reason for this, Achilles, and I will tell you. But swear that you will protect me, because what I'm going to say will offend a man who has power over all the Achaeans and whom all the Achaeans obey. I'm risking my life: swear that you will protect me."<br><br>Achilles told him not to be afraid, but to say what he knew. He said, "As long as I live, no one among the Achaeans will dare raise a hand against you. No one. Not even Agamemnon."<br><br>Then the seer took courage and said, "When we offended that old man, suffering came upon us. Agamemnon refused the ransom and would not give up the daughter of Chryses: and suffering came upon us. There is only one way to rid ourselves of it: restore to Chryses that girl with the sparkling eyes, before it's too late." Thus he spoke, and he sat down.<br><br>Agamemnon rose, his heart brimming with black fury and his eyes flashing fire. He looked at Calchas with hatred and said, "Prophet of doom, you have never given me a favorable prophecy. You like to reveal only evil, never good. And now you want to deprive me of Chryseis, whom I desire more than my own wife, Clytemnestra, and who rivals her in beauty, intelligence, and nobility of spirit. Must I give her up? I will do so, because I want the army to be saved. I will do it, if so it must be. But find me a prize to replace her immediately, because it is not right that I alone, among the Achaeans, should remain without honor. I want another prize for myself."<br><br>Then Achilles said, "How can we find you a prize, Agamemnon? The spoils have already been divided, and it wouldn't be fitting to start over again from the beginning. Give back the girl and we'll repay you three, four times over when we capture Ilium."<br><br>Agamemnon shook his head. "You don't deceive me, Achilles. You want to keep your prize and leave me with nothing. No, I will give back that girl and then I'll come and take what I like, and maybe I'll take something from Ajax, or Odysseus, or maybe I'll take something from you."<br><br>Achilles looked at him with hatred. "You insolent, greedy man," he said. "And you expect the Achaeans to follow you into battle? I didn't come here to fight the Trojans&#x2014;they haven't done anything to me. They haven't stolen oxen or horses from me, or destroyed my harvest: my land is divided from theirs by shadowy mountains and a roaring sea. I'm here because I followed you, arrogant man, to defend Menelaus's honor and yours. And you, you bastard, dog face, you couldn't care less, and threaten to take away the prize I fought for? No, it's better that I return home rather than stay to be dishonored, fighting to win treasures and riches for you."<br><br>Then Agamemnon answered, "Go if you want, I won't beg you to stay. Others will gain honor at my side. I don't like you, Achilles: you love quarrel, strife, war. You're strong, it's true, but that's a gift. Leave, go home and rule in your own house. You are nothing to me, and I'm not afraid of your anger. Let me tell you this: I will send Chryseis back to her father, on my ship, with my men. But then I'll come to your tent and take for myself the beautiful Briseis, your prize, so that you'll know who is the stronger, and all men will learn to fear me."<br><br>Thus he spoke. And it was as if he had struck Achilles a blow to the heart. And the son of Peleus was about to unsheathe his sword and certainly would have killed Agamemnon if at the last minute he had not mastered his fury and stopped his hand on the silver hilt. He looked at Agamemnon and in a rage said:<br><br>"You with the face of a dog, the heart of a deer&#x2014;you coward. I swear on this scepter that the day will come when the Achaeans, all of them, will long for me. When they are dropping under Hector's assaults, they will long for me. And you will suffer for them, but will be able to do nothing. You will only remember the day you insulted the best of the Achaeans, and go mad with rage and remorse. That day will come, Agamemnon. I swear it."<br><br>Thus he spoke, and hurled the gold-studded scepter to the ground.<br><br>When the assembly broke up, Agamemnon ordered one of his ships brought down to the sea, assigned to it twenty men, and put in charge Odysseus, the wily one. Then he came to me, took me by the hand, and led me to the ship. "Beautiful Chryseis," he said. And he let me return to my father and my homeland. He stood there, on the shore, watching the ship set sail.<br><br>When he saw it disappear over the horizon he called two men among his loyal followers and ordered them to go to the tent of Achilles, to take Briseis by the hand and lead her away. He said to them, "If Achilles refuses to give her up, then tell him that I will come and get her, and it will be much worse for him." The two soldiers were called Talthybios and Eurybates. They set off reluctantly along the shore of the sea and finally reached the camp of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting beside his tent and his black ship. They stood before him and said nothing, because they were frightened and in awe of the king. So it was he who spoke.<br><br>"Come," he said. "You're not at fault in all this&#x2014;Agamemnon is. Don't be afraid." Then he called Patroclus and told him to fetch Briseis and hand her over to the two soldiers, so that they could lead her away. "You are my witnesses," he said, looking at them. "Agamemnon is foolish. He doesn't think about what will happen, he doesn't think about when he might need me to defend the Achaeans and their ships. To him nothing matters in the past or the future. You are my witnesses, that man is a fool."<br><br>The men set off, retracing their path beside the swift ships of the Achaeans, drawn up on the beach. Behind them walked beautiful Briseis. Sadly she went&#x2014;and reluctant.<br><br>Achilles watched them go. And then he went and sat alone on the shore of the white-foaming sea, and burst into tears, with the infinite ocean before him. He was the lord of the war and the terror of every Trojan. But he burst into tears and like a child began calling his mother. From far away she came, then, and appeared to him. She sat beside him and stroked him gently. Softly, she called him by name. "My son, why did I bring you into the world, I, your unhappy mother? Your life will be short enough. If only you could spend it without tears and without sorrow."<br><br>Achilles asked, "Can you save me, Mother? Can you do it?"<br><br>But his mother said only, "Listen to me: stay here, near the ships, and don't go into battle. Hold on to your anger against the Achaeans and don't yield to your desire for war. I tell you: one day they will offer you shining gifts, and they'll give you three times as many, for the insult you received." Then she disappeared, and Achilles sat there, alone. His soul was filled with rage for the injustice he had suffered, and his heart was consumed by yearning for the cry of battle and the tumult of war.<br><br>I saw my city again when the ship, commanded by Odysseus, entered the harbor. The sails were lowered, the ship approached the mooring under oars. The crew threw the anchors over and tied the stern ropes. First they unloaded the animals for sacrifice to Apollo. Then Odysseus took me by the hand and led me to land. He guided me to the altar of Apollo, where my father was waiting for me. He let me go, and my father took me in his arms, overcome with joy.<br><br>Odysseus and h...</p><h2>In the Spirit of Aspen (Colorado)</h2><p>Eclectic, eccentric, and smart, Aspen has always been a pioneer of style.

Wes Hendricks is an old-time rancher who loves his land and animals and refuses to sell out to make way for progress in the shape of an artificial lake that will flood his home. His grandson, Jim Ed, sent to convince him to sell, gradually becomes a supporter of his grandfather. The old ways of Wes and the new ways of Jim Ed and Glory Be (neighbor and romantic element) are joined and all ends well. Very pleasant reading by a much-praised Texas author.

So when Robert Smedley walks through the door, determined to prove that his wife is cheating, Raisin Investigations immediately offers to help. Trouble is, Agatha hates divorce cases--especially when the client is as pompous as Smedley--but she has a business to run and she's not about to turn away a paying customer. Unfortunately for Agatha, Mabel Smedley appears to be the perfect wife, young and pretty and a regular volunteer at church. </p><p>Although Smedley's case doesn't look promising, Agatha's attentions are diverted when she stumbles across the body of missing teenager, Jessica Bradley. In a sudden gesture of kindness (and good public relations), Agatha offers to investigate Jessica's death free of charge. </p><p>In M.C. Beaton's <i>The Perfect Paragon</i>, as Agatha juggles her two biggest cases, things are turned upside down when Robert Smedley is found poisoned in his office. The prime suspect, his sainted wife Mabel, immediately hires Agatha to find the real killer. </p><p>With the help of her old friend, Sir Charles Fraith, and some newly hired staff, Agatha Raisin sets off on another adventure solving crime in the English Cotswolds.</p></p><p><p>AGATHA RAISIN...AND THE CASE FROM HELLShe's nosed in on murder investigations, annoyed law enforcement on two continents, and been targeted by everyone from a hit man to a killer secretary. But now Agatha Raisin must take on her greatest nightmare&#x2015;a divorce case. Bad enough that her struggling detective agency needs the whacking great fee pompous businessman Robert Smedley is offering to prove his wife is unfaithful; it's even worse that Mrs. Smedley is the kind of sweet, accomplished, lovely, gentle, and all-around perfectly wonderful spouse that Agatha couldn't be in a thousand years. So, when Smedley turns up poisoned, Agatha is relieved enough to help his now-desperate wife clear her name. And with the assistance of her firm's eccentric new staff, Agatha enthusiastically follows leads and a batch of suspects through the English countryside's seediest byways. But the police aren't about to let an interfering "amateur" beat them to the punch. And as Agatha hits one dead end after another, a particularly devious killer is looking forward to making sure the indomitable Agatha never has to worry about old age&#x2015;or anything else.</p>Praise for M.

But when he killed a poor tenant farmer in front of eight witnesses, the law was bound to catch up with him. In his contempt for the law, Wallace had inadvertently crossed the county line from Meriwether into Coweta, Sheriff Lamar Potts's county. And the sheriff pursued him relentlessly. Potts ignored threats and pleas as he conducted his investigation; arrested the sheriff of Meriwether County, who was protecting Wallace; and eventually scraped up just enough corpus delicti to fill a small cartridge box.</p><p>The trial that followed was the first in Georgia in which a white man-and one who held such great power locally-was convicted on the testimony of black witnesses. Despite numerous appeals and delays, Wallace was finally executed, and Potts became the embodiment of justice in Coweta County.</p><p>Not only is this a true story of a brutal murder that took place in the rural South, but it is a chillingly realistic reconstruction of both the crime and the brilliant investigation that brought the culprit to justice. The atmosphere and social structure of rustic Georgia in 1948 come alive in this fascinating book while the actions and attitudes of the residents leap from the pages with a stunning authenticity. Sheriff Lamar Potts emerges as a brave and honest man of action determined to see justice done.</p><p>Author Margaret Anne Barnes studied journalism at the University of Georgia.

Although Americans had been shocked by the assassination in 1963 of President Kennedy, they exuded a sense of consensus and optimism that showed no signs of abating. Indeed, political liberalism and interracial civil rights activism made it appear as if 1965 would find America more progressive and unified than it had ever been before. In January 1965, President Lyndon Johnson proclaimed that the country had no irreconcilable conflicts.&#x201d;<br><br>Johnson, who was an extraordinarily skillful manager of Congress, succeeded in securing an avalanche of Great Society legislation in 1965, including Medicare, immigration reform, and a powerful Voting Rights Act. But as esteemed historian James T. Patterson reveals in <i>The Eve of Destruction</i>, that sense of harmony dissipated over the course of the year. As Patterson shows, 1965 marked the birth of the tumultuous era we now know as The Sixties,&#x201d; when American society and culture underwent a major transformation. Turmoil erupted in the American South early in the year, when police attacked civil rights demonstrators in Selma, Alabama. Many black leaders, outraged, began to lose faith in nonviolent and interracial strategies of protest. Meanwhile, the U.S. rushed into a deadly war in Vietnam, inciting rebelliousness at home. On August 11th, five days after Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, racial violence exploded in the Watts area of Los Angeles. The six days of looting and arson that followed shocked many Americans and cooled their enthusiasm for the president's remaining initiatives. As the national mood darkened, the country became deeply divided. By the end of 1965, a conservative resurgence was beginning to redefine the political scene even as developments in popular music were enlivening the Left.<br><br>In <i>The Eve of Destruction</i>, Patterson traces the events of this transformative year, showing how they dramatically reshaped the nation and reset the course of American life.</p><p>James T. Patterson is Ford Foundation Professor of History Emeritus at Brown University. Author of <i>Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush v. Gore, Brown v. Board of Education</i>, and the Bancroft Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945-1974</i>, he lives in Providence, Rhode Island.<br><i>The Eve of Destruction</i> is impossible to put down, an exciting but also disturbing look at 1965, the year when what we now think of as the sixties' really began. For those of us who admire the great liberal achievements of the civil rights movement, Lyndon B. Johnson, and the 89th Congress, James Patterson has written a cautionary tale, showing how and why a conservative reaction that's still with us began building at liberalism's zenith. And the fateful, gradual escalation of the Vietnam War haunts this account, as it came to haunt LBJ. Those who lived through 1965 will want to read this book; those who didn't ought to read it to understand today's political world.&#x201d;<b>&nbsp;</b><br><br><b>John Dittmer, author of <i>Local People: The Struggle for Civil Rights in Mississippi</i></b> While in many respects 1965 was a very good year the Voting Rights Act, Head Start, and Medicare come quickly to mind trouble lay ahead. The civil rights coalition was starting to unravel just as the specter of Vietnam loomed large on the horizon. In this illuminating, absorbing, page-turner of a book, James T. Patterson makes the case that After 1965, for better and for worse, the United States would never be the same again.'&#x201d;<br> Smart, thoughtful, fast-paced, engaging, and insightful these are just a few of the adjectives that describe James T. Patterson's masterful new book, <i>The Eve of Destruction</i>. Patterson makes a convincing case that you cannot understand America today without coming to terms with this eventful, and in some cases, tragic, year.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br><b>David M. Kennedy, Professor of History Emeritus, Stanford University</b> Philip Roth once called the immediate post-World War II decades the greatest moment of collective inebriation in American history.' James Patterson's <i>The Eve of Destruction</i> chronicles the origins of the awful reckoning that followed. Focusing on the single, fateful year of 1965, Patterson's masterful account details the incipient fissures in American society that grew into gaping chasms by the decade's end. A sobering and essential read about a world we have lost and the troubled birth of our own.&#x201d;<br><br><b>E. J. Dionne Jr., author of <i>Our Divided Political Heart</i></b><br><br><b>Alan Brinkley, author of <i>John F. Kennedy </i></b><br> James Patterson, one of the most prolific and thoughtful historians of our generation, has written a brilliant book that shows us how the 1960s became such a destructive period in our recent history. It was not because of the youth revolt, nor even because of the civil rights movement, but because of Lyndon Johnson's embrace of the Vietnam War.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Jonathan Yardley, <i>Washington Post</i></b><br> Reading Patterson's chronicle, I am all too painfully put back in that terrible year [1965], with all the shock and disenchantment it brought . <i>The Eve of Destruction</i> should be read as a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris and, by no means incidentally, the dangers of misreading election returns as mandates.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Wall Street Journal</b></i><br> Patterson argues correctly, I think that 1965 was one of those hinge years&#x201d; when history turns and goes in another, unexpected direction. The history of a single year isn't easy to write, but Mr. Patterson handles the task well . All in all, <i>The Eve of Destruction</i> is an illuminating look at a remarkably significant year by a master historian.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Michael Beschloss</b>&nbsp; One of America's greatest historians makes a powerful argument that the most important historical pivot of the revolutionary 1960s was not President Kennedy's assassination or the tumult of 1968, but the fateful moment when Lyndon Johnson, at his zenith, turned from his Great Society to escalate the war in Vietnam, and when his passage of the Voting Rights Act was quickly followed by riots in Watts.&nbsp; So evocatively does James Patterson take us back into the vanished world of 1965 that many readers will wish they could travel back in time and somehow change the tragic arc of history.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Ira Katznelson, Ruggles Professor of Political Science and History, Columbia University</b>&nbsp; Based on rich learning and resonant with thoughtful interpretations, this incisive and lucid book does more than identify a point of inflection. Its fascinating chronicle captures and explains how a configuration of racial and social change, popular culture, robust legislative action, and a fierce and often brutal war as well as unrest at home decisively altered the vectors of American life in ways that simply had not been anticipated just before 1965.&#x201d;<b>&nbsp;</b><br><br><b>Steven M.

Writing in an informative, accessible manner, Patterson creates a strong narrative, his recitation of facts helping to build his case that 1965 rather than 1968 or 1969 marked a political, cultural, and military turning point for America.&#x201d;<br><i><b>Boston Globe</b></i><br> [<i>The Eve of Destruction</i>] is no romantic romp of nostalgia. It is a searching look at a year that spawned Lyndon Johnson's Great Society legacy of legislation on education, civil rights, and health and produced a high tide of American liberalism even as bloody confrontations at Selma, bombings in North Vietnam, and a credibility gap in the capital showed cracks in the American edifice . Meticulously described and deftly analyzed.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>San Francisco Chronicle</b></i><br> Our yearlong pivot from self-congratulation to national turmoil and near-rupture is the topic of <i>The Eve of Destruction</i>, an engaging chronicle by James T. Patterson, author of the Bancroft Prize-winning <i>Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945-1974</i> . By focusing on the widening gyre of crisis Selma, Pleiku, Saigon, Watts Patterson persuasively argues for the inclusion of 1965 in an elite roster of transformative years. His narrative imparts the dizzying speed of events that left so many Americans wondering what was happening to their country and whether government really could meet the era's daunting new challenges.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Long Patrol</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

Illustrated with the author&#39;s own detailed watercolors. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Hampton, whose star rose some time ago in the firmament of interior decoration, here gazes back on a century of taste in home design, opining that a onetime pastime of idle 19th-century ladies has edged much closer to Art. He sketches the professional--and sometimes the private--lives of the industry's demi-gods, modestly presenting himself as an acolyte. Hampton's witty, well-crafted biographies include everyone from Elsie de Wolfe (who claimed she was the first interior decorator) to David Hicks and Michael Taylor, the author's immediate predecessors. We are also allowed a glimpse into the narrow world of American wealth that eagerly defined class as displayed in home possessions. Woven into the book as well is a tale of the development of an upper-class American domestic sensibility. Hampton's own preferences lean toward a relatively clean and simple traditional look that breaks away from fuss and pretension, but makes no attempt to be egalitarian. He illustrates his book with his own hand, in accomplished but homogeneous watercolors of 22 decorators' interiors. Author tour; first serial to House Beautiful. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Focusing on interior decorators for whom decorating was a livelihood (rather than architects who dabbled in decorating), Hampton has written an enthusiastic, personal narrative describing each decorator's style and his or her relationship with clients. His watercolors show the work of 22 decorators, including "Sister" Parrish, Michael Taylor, and Jean-Michel Frank. Unfortunately, the biographical information is sketchy; for example, in describing Ruby Ross Wood's life, Hampton notes, "Somewhere along here, she has been married and divorced." However, this is the only book available that gives a historic view of West and East Coast decorators as well as those from Europe. Recommended where there is a strong patron interest in interior design.<br><i>-Gayle A.

In this rambling and rather slight memoir of some of his experiences on and off the fairway, Trevino manages to convey the sense of fun he gets from the game. He has met such notables as Prince Rainier and Gerald Ford, and, as one might expect, he is not easily fazed by them. Despite the light touch, Trevino's respect for his fellow professionals is most apparent. Photographs not seen. Not an essential purchase for most sports collections.

The Sally books are wonderfully witty glimpses into the simple psyche of a dog, where exciting new smells and tastes reign supreme.

The doggy duo then eats like pigs, horses around, plows a field, and narrowly escapes a goosing.

Curtis (1868&#x2013;1952). Curtis is the best-known photographer of Native Americans because of his monumental work, <i>The North American Indian</i> (1907&#x2013;1930), which consists of twenty portfolios of large photogravures and twenty volumes of text on more than eighty Indian groups in the West. He took pictures of Plains Indians for over twenty years, and his photographs reflect both prevailing attitudes about Indians and Curtis's own vision of differences among the Native peoples whom he photographed.&nbsp;Curtis's photographs have exerted an enduring influence&#x2014;both positive and negative&#x2014;on mainstream American culture. They have inspired countless books, articles, and photographic exhibitions, and they continue to appear on posters, postcards, and other souvenirs. Accompanying the remarkable array of images in this book are essays by leading scholars that place the photographs within their proper critical, cultural, and historical contexts. The scholars contributing to this work are Martha H. Kennedy, Martha A. Sandweiss, Mick Gidley, and Duane Niatum.</p><p>Curtis, the preeminent photographer of North American Indians, was born in 1868 and died in virtual obscurity in 1952, after taking more than 40,000 photos. Over the course of more than two decades (1907-30), he published 20 legendary portfolios of 80 Indian tribes that were reproduced by Taschen in one volume in 1997. Essays by four scholars complement the 91 photographs--with Curtis' own captions--in this striking book. Here are Indian chiefs, warriors and scouts, sun dancers, a young Sioux woman in deerskin, an Assiniboin mother and child, a Cree girl, and an Apsaroke medicine tepee. Martha Kennedy's introduction offers a historical background to Curtis' life and work. One essay places Curtis' photographs in their cultural context; another discusses the magnitude of his work--its scale, duration, and complexity. Yet another essay focuses on what the writer calls the photographer's aesthetic impulse and the ways he used the camera to accomplish his artistic ambitions. This book is a major addition to the countless works on Curtis. <i>George Cohen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

However one feels about Curtis's project, it's hard not to be impressed by its scope: The North American Indian, which constitutes about one-third of his total oeuvre, consists of 20 volumes of large photogravures and 20 volumes of illustrated text on more than 80 tribal groups which the 91 photos here can only begin to suggest. Kennedy notes "a widespread tendency to regard Plains Indians as representative... of all American Indians."

Simultaneous.</p><p>ANN PATCHETT is the author of six novels, including <em>Bel Canto,</em> winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award and the Orange Prize<em>.</em> She has written for the<em> Atlantic,&nbsp;Gourmet, </em>the <em>New York Times Magazine, Vogue, </em>the <em>Washington Post</em>, and others<em>.</em>Introduction The short story is in need of a scandal.<br> The short story should proclaim itself to be based on actual events and then, after a series of fiery public denials, it should hold a press conference in Cannes and make a brave but faltering confession: None of it actually happened. It was fiction all along. Yes, despite what&#x2019;s been said, it has always been fiction and it is proud to be fiction. The short story should consider staging its own kidnapping and then show up three weeks later in The New Yorker claiming that some things happened that cannot be discussed. Or perhaps the short story could seek out the celebrity endorsement of someone we never expected, maybe Tiger Woods, who could claim that he couldn&#x2019;t imagine going out to the ninth hole without a story in his back pocket. They are just the right size for reading between rounds of golf. It doesn&#x2019;t really matter what the short story chooses to do, but it needs to do something. The story needs hype. It needs a publicist. Fast.<br> I can speak to the matter with great authority because I&#x2019;ve been reading a lot of short stories lately, and the very large majority of them have been shockingly good. They are better than the novels I&#x2019;ve been reading. They are more daring, more artful, and more original. Yet while I know plenty of people with whom I can discuss novels, there are only two people I know with whom I can swoon over short stories: Katrina Kenison (more on her later) and my friend Kevin Wilson, a young writer who reads literary magazines the way other people read pulpy spy novels, the kind of friend you can call in the middle of the night and ask, Have you read the latest issue of Tin House?&#x201d; As valuable as these friendships have been to me, I am sorry to say they are not enough. Since I have recently given my life over to short stories I need to find a larger audience than two. I have the zeal of a religious convert. I want to stand in the airport passing out copies of One Story and The Agni Review. I want to talk to total strangers about plot and character and language, about what makes that Maxine Swann story so moving and the David Bezmozgis so surprising. How did that Kevin Moffett story manage to lull me into such a trance? I&#x2019;m more than willing to take the message to the people, but the short story is going to have to work with me here. It needs to be a little less demure.<br> The first thing the short story needs to think about is casting off the role of The Novel&#x2019;s Little Sidekick, the practice run, the warm-up act. I was extolling the virtues of a particularly dazzling short story to an editor friend recently when she cut me off in mid-sentence, said she didn&#x2019;t want to hear it. I&#x2019;ll only fall in love,&#x201d; she said bitterly, and then I won&#x2019;t be able to buy the book, and if I do buy the book I won&#x2019;t be able to sell it.&#x201d; Short stories, it seems, are a dead-end romance in publishing. In the rare instance when a house finally does break down and buy a collection, the usual stipulation is that it must be followed by a novel, a.k.a. something that might sell. But must one think so far down the road as to how things will end? Love the short story for what it is, a handful of pages in a magazine. The short story isn&#x2019;t asking to be a collection, and it certainly isn&#x2019;t trying to pass itself off as a potential novel. Who&#x2019;s to say the short story writer has a novel in him? Is a sprinter accepted to the team on the condition that she will also run a marathon? Certainly many people do both, and some people do both well, but it always seems clear to me when a novelist has turned out a short story or a short story writer has stretched a piece into a novel. There are a handful of people who to my mind are equal in their talents, John Updike leading the list, but then John Updike could probably win a hundred-meter race as handily as he could run cross-country.<br> It was a genuine challenge to pick a mere twenty stories out of the more than one hundred twenty I received. I would have been happier turning in thirty or even forty, so many of them were excellent, and yet I know I couldn&#x2019;t put my hands on the twenty Best American Novels for 2006. So what accounts for so many successful stories? (Remembering, of course, that this is not actually a volume of the best short stories in America. These are just the stories that I like best, and I am full of prejudice and strong opinions. The genius of this series, and certainly the reason for its longevity, is that it relies on guest editors who arrive every year with all their own baggage about what constitutes a wonderful story, and as soon as they feel comfortable in their role as the arbiter of Best they are replaced by another writer who is equally sure of his or her own taste. That&#x2019;s one thing you can say for writers we know what we like when it comes to writing.) It could be that stories are easier to write than novels, but having taken a crack at both myself I am doubtful of this. I think it is more the case that short stories are expendable. Because they are smaller, the writer is simply more willing to learn from her mistakes and throw the bad ones and the only pretty good ones away. Knowing that something can be thrown away encourages more risk taking, which in turn usually leads to better writing. It&#x2019;s a sad thing to toss out a bad short story, but in the end it always comes as a relief. On the other hand, it takes a real nobility to dump the bad novel. The novel represents so much time that the writer often struggles valiantly to publish it even when it would be in everyone&#x2019;s best interest to chalk it up to education and walk away. I know a lot of people who published the first novel they ever wrote. I can think of no one who published his first short story.<br> So why, if what I&#x2019;m telling you is true, and let&#x2019;s assume for the sake of this introduction that it is, aren&#x2019;t more people running out to buy their copy of Harper&#x2019;s and turning directly from the index to the short story? Short stories are less expensive, often better written, and make fewer demands on our time. Why haven&#x2019;t we made a deeper commitment to them? I am afraid it has something to do with the story&#x2019;s inability to cause a stir. As a novelist I would say I read well over the average number of novels (whatever that is) per year. It doesn&#x2019;t take much to get me to read something new. I&#x2019;ll pick up a novel based on a compelling review, the recommendation of a friend, even a particularly eye-catching cover. I troll the summer reading tables in bookstores to fill in the holes in my education. I am forever picking up something I&#x2019;ve always meant to read (Zeno&#x2019;s Conscience is on the bedside table now waiting for me to finish writing this, and there is still so much Dickens). But everything I mean to read, and nearly everything I have read no matter how obscure, has had some means of catching my attention. The uncollected short story in its magazine or literary journal has nothing but the author&#x2019;s name and possibly a catchy title to flag you down. Only in its largest venues does a short story manage to score an illustration. It does not go out and get you. It waits for you. It waits and waits and waits.<br> Unless of course you have the brilliant good fortune to be chosen as the editor of The Best American Short Stories one year. Because while a single short story may have a difficult time raising enough noise on its own to be heard over the din of civilization, short stories in bulk can have the effect of swarming bees, blocking out sound and sun and becoming the only thing you can think about. So even though it goes against my nature to point out the ways in which I am luckier than you, I must say that in this case I am, unless you too have short stories mailed to your home. And even if you did have stories mailed to your home, you probably didn&#x2019;t get them from Katrina Kenison, and that&#x2019;s where my real advantage comes in. These aren&#x2019;t just any short stories I&#x2019;ve been getting, the normal cross section of good and bad. These stories have been intelligently and lovingly culled from the vast sea of those that are published. Katrina does the part of this project that is work, hacking her way through all that is boring and poorly written in order to send me the gems. She reads everything so that I can read what is good, and I read everything that is good in order to put together everything that I think is best. Stories have been showing up on my doorstep in padded envelopes, a steady stream of fiction that I piled in strategic locations near bedsides and bathtubs and back doors. When you get enough short stories spread around the house, they gather a force of momentum. The more stories I read, the more I wanted to read stories, the more I recommended stories, the more the stories created their own hype simply by being so vast and varied and good. The stories offered me their companionship, each one a complete experience in a limited amount of time. No matter where I went, I did not mind waiting, seeing as how I was rich in stories. I went ahead and pulled into the endlessly long line at the touchless car wash on Sunday morning, took a story out of the glove compartment, and started reading. I was able to put other work aside in order to read because for this period of time short stories were my job. I did not have the smallest twinge of guilt about lying on the sofa for days at a time reading. Could there be anything better than that? I felt as if I had spent the year in one of those total-immersion language camps, and in the end I emerged fluent in the language of short fiction.<br> Of course I was no beginner. While I can trace the short story back to my earliest days as a reader, my true connection came when I was twelve years old, the year I read Eudora Welty&#x2019;s A Visit of Charity.&#x201d; There had been other stories before this, stories I liked, The Necklace&#x201d; and The Gift of the Magi,&#x201d; the stock assignments that were the backbone of every junior high English class, but A Visit of Charity,&#x201d; even though it was a story about a girl, seemed infinitely more grown-up to me. It didn&#x2019;t reward the reader with a plot twist at the end or present a clear moral imperative. Even more startling was the fact that this author, whose photograph and biographical paragraph preceded the text, had only one date after her name, 1909, and then a dash, and then nothing. Again and again I returned to that photograph to look at the long, gentle face of the author. She was both alive and in a textbook, a coupling I had never seen before. As sure as I was by the age of twelve that I wanted to be a writer, I was not at all sure that it was the sort of thing the living did. The short fiction market was cornered by dead people, and this Eudora Welty was, as far as I could tell, the first one to have broken the trend. I decided at the start of seventh grade to cast my lot with the living and chose Eudora Welty as my favorite writer, a decision that has served me well ever since. Four years later I was sixteen when Miss Welty came to Vanderbilt to give a reading, and I got there early and sat in the front row holding my big, hardback Collected Short Stories of Eudora Welty, which my mother had bought me for my birthday that year. It was the first reading I had ever been to, and when it was over I had her sign my book. I held it open to the wrong page, and she looked at me, and said, No, no, dear. You always want to sign on the title page.&#x201d; And she took the book from me and did it right. For the sheer force of its heart-stopping, life-changing wonder, I will put this experience up against that of anyone who ever saw the Beatles.<br> The short story has made some progress since the dark ages of the middle seventies, and I do believe that the living are now taking up their fair number of pages beside Hemingway and Faulkner. With Alice Munro leading the way, a case could be made that we are living in the golden age of the short story this very minute. A golden age there for the taking.<br> The impressions we pick up as children, when our minds are still open to influence and as soft as damp sponges, are likely to stay with us the longest. Ever since I saw that picture of Eudora Welty alive and well in my seventh-grade reader, I haven&#x2019;t been able to shake the notion that short story writers are famous people and that short stories are life-altering things. I believe it is human nature to try and persuade others that our most passionately held beliefs are true so that they too can know the joy of our deepest convictions. I was standing in my kitchen fixing breakfast the morning I heard on the radio that Eudora Welty had died. It was July 2001, and I remember that the room was full of light. I called my good friend Barry Moser, the illustrator who had worked with Miss Welty on that most memorable edition of The Robber Bridegroom, and told him I was going to the funeral. He said he would meet me there.<br> I spent that night in Meridian, Mississippi, with my mother-in-law, and in the morning I made the short trip to Jackson. There was a rainstorm on the way that made the last leg a harrowing drive, but just as I got to town the weather cleared and cooled. I picked up Barry and his wife, Emily, and the three of us went to the church together a full two hours before the service was scheduled to begin. We went that early because we were certain it was the only way we would ever get a seat. I expected people to be waiting in the streets. I was ready to stand in the street myself, but we were the first ones to arrive. And while the church was full, in the end there were still a few empty seats around the edges. The coffin seemed tiny to me, but then Miss Welty had been growing shorter over the years. There were plenty of stories about her being barely able to see over the steering wheel of her car.<br> If you have ever been to Mississippi in July, you will know there is no reprieve from the heat, and yet on this particular day the rain, which under normal circumstances only makes the situation worse, had somehow made it better. When we went to the graveside it was no more than seventy-five degrees, and thus the closest thing to divine intervention I have ever experienced. When the hero of my life was buried, I had a discreet cry among friends standing in the cemetery. A woman approached me and introduced herself as Mary Alice Welty White. I knew her, of course. My beloved collected stories was dedicated to her and her sister, Elizabeth Welty Thompson. I had seen her name every time I opened the book. Mary Alice Welty White asked me my name. She asked me if I was a friend of her aunt&#x2019;s, and I said I was not. I told her I was a great admirer and had come to pay my respects. Then she asked me where I was from.<br> She took my arm. There&#x2019;s someone I want you to meet.&#x201d; We took small steps. The ground was soft, and we were both wearing heels. She led me to the line of cars that had driven over to the cemetery and to a group of teenaged boys who were leaning up against those cars. Their ties were loose, and their jackets were off. They were ready to get out of there.<br> She introduced me to one of the young men. He didn&#x2019;t seem as if he would have been especially interested to meet anyone. This is Ann Patchett,&#x201d; Mary Alice Welty White told him. She drove all the way from Nashville to come to your aunt Dodo&#x2019;s funeral. She didn&#x2019;t even know her, and she drove all this way. That&#x2019;s how important your aunt Dodo was.&#x201d; The boy and I exchanged an awkward how-do-you-do and shook hands. Mary Alice thanked me for coming.<br> Even at the funeral of the greatest short story writer of our time, a member of her own family needed to be reminded of her standing. The short story never was one for calling a lot of attention to itself, but in the face of so much brilliance I think it&#x2019;s time we started paying our respects.<br> The Best American Short Stories is the short story Olympic...</p><h2>Wonder/henry Sugar</h2><p>An account of how Roald Dahl came to be a writer and selections from his writer&#39;s notebook augment stories juxtaposing fantasy and truth and peopled with characters both outrageous and courageous</p><p>If you could see with your eyes closed, how would you use your power?

Passions are so enflamed that Thomas Pitt, shrewd mainstay of the London police, has been ordered, not to solve a crime, but to prevent a national disaster. The aristocratic Tory candidate&#x2014;and Pitt&#x2019;s archenemy&#x2014;is Charles Voisey. The Liberal candidate is Aubrey Serracold, whose wife&#x2019;s dalliance with spiritualism threatens his chances. Indeed, she is one of the participants in a late-night s�ance that becomes the swan song of a stylish clairvoyant who is found brutally murdered the next morning in her house on Southampton Row. Meanwhile, Pitt&#x2019;s wife, Charlotte, and their children are enjoying a country vacation&#x2014;unaware that they, too, are deeply endangered by the same fanatical forces hovering over the steadfast Pitt. . . .</p><p>Thomas Pitt prefers the grim routine of murder investigations to the riskier probing of Victorian governmental intrigues. Yet Anne Perry's <i>Southampton Row</i> again finds him displaced from his police command, this time to foil the political ambitions of a ruthless republican.<p> Charles Voisey, leader of a powerful secret society known as the Inner Circle, was defeated by Pitt when he tried (in <i>The Whitechapel Conspiracy</i>) to abolish the British monarchy. Only months later, though, he's back on top, running for a seat in Parliament. Under the auspices of the newly created Special Branch, Pitt is charged with learning whether Voisey has any "unguarded vulnerabilities." The odds against Pitt succeeding are high; Voisey may be "shallow, self-important [and] condescending," but he impresses voters as more charismatic and less controversial than his opponent, Aubrey Serracold, who's also hobbled by his connection to the recent slaying of a popular spiritualist. While Pitt's wife, Charlotte, and their family are safely out of London on vacation, Pitt, aided by the gruff but dogged Inspector Samuel Tellman, his politically astute sister-in law, and Charlotte's resourceful great-aunt Vespasia, seeks to solve the medium's murder before it can derail Aubrey Serracold's campaign.</p><p> Perry expertly portrays the volatile British political climate of the 1890s, and by making Pitt and Tellman rivals in their investigation, she further illuminates both men's characters. However, <i>Southampton Row</i> reduces the usually intrepid Charlotte to a hand-wringing irrelevance, and the novel feels too much like an intermediate and inconclusive chapter in a longer story arc. Like Holmes and Moriarty, Thomas Pitt and Charles Voisey appear destined to grapple once more. <i>--J.
